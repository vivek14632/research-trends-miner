The realization of this promise depends on the validity of two assumptions: (1) individuals can be helped to be more creative and (2) software, appropriately designed, can provide this help. Evidence from creativity research supports the first assumption. This paper explores the second assumption. A set of guidelines for designing DSS is developed from the creativity literature and two hypotheses involving the use of a DSS developed in accordance with these guidelines are proposed. To test these hypotheses, an experiment involving three groups of auditors from a \u201cbig eight\u201d accounting firm was conducted. Each group was asked to respond to two different decision situations. Two groups were given separate versions of a DSS specifically selected because it contained features that were thought to enhance creativity. Another group was given no software. The results of the experiment indicate significant differences in the creativity of the responses generated by the three groups. Possible explanations for these differences are explored."}, "1/1/article2": {"year": "1990", "volume": "1", "issue": "1", "title": "An Integrative Model of Information Systems Spending Growth", "authors": ["Vijay GurbaxaniGraduate School of Management, University of California, Irvine, California 92717", "Haim MendelsonGraduate School of Business, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305"], "keywords": ["  information systems expenditures ", " budget ", " diffusion of innovation ", " demand for computing ", " computing costs "], "abstract": "This paper develops a model of the growth of information systems expenditures in the United States.

Findings supported hypotheses that earlier adopters of spreadsheet software were younger, more highly educated, more attuned to mass media, more involved in interpersonal communication, and more likely to be opinion leaders. Also supported was the hypothesized sigmoidal distribution of adoption over time. Application of the theory was not supported in all areas, however, suggesting that information technology diffusion is different from other diffusion phenomena. Contrary to theory, interpersonal channels of communication were dominant in all phases of adoption decision making.

Although there has been a considerable amount of research into problem solving using graphs and tables, until recently the circumstances in which each is more effective have been largely unresolved. Recent research has suggested that performance benefits accrue when cognitive fit occurs, i.e., when factors such as the problem representation and problem solving tools match the characteristics of the task. In this paper, we investigate the effects of the basic paradigm of cognitive fit and extensions to the paradigm in a laboratory experiment that examined the nature of subjects' mental representations as well as problem-solving performance. The experiment, using 128 MBA students in two identical, repeated measures designs, produced the following results:\n\u2022 Performance improved markedly for symbolic tasks when the problem representation matched the task.\nPerformance effects also resulted from matching specific problem-solving skills to the problem representation and the task, and to a lesser extent when the skills matched the task alone.\n\u2022 The incremental effects of matching skills to the problem representation and/or the task were small compared with the primary effects of cognitive fit-that of matching problem representation to task.\n\u2022 A large proportion of problem solvers have insight into the concept of supporting tasks with certain types of problem representation and vice versa.\n\u2022 Participants preferred to use tables rather than graphs; they also preferred to solve symbolic rather than spatial problems.\nFinally, the problem representation more significantly influenced the mental representation than did task conceptualization.\nThis research suggests that providing decision support systems to satisfy individual managers' desires will not have a large effect on either the efficiency or the effectiveness of problem solving. Designers should, instead, concentrate on determining the characteristics of the tasks that problem solvers must address, and on supporting those tasks with the appropriate problem representations and support tools.

This will assist both academics and practitioners interested in the use of information systems to support managerial workers. This paper proposes the use of a cognitive effort model of decision making to explain decision maker behavior when assisted by a DSS. The central proposition is that specific features can be incorporated within a DSS that will alter the effort required to implement a particular strategy, and thus influence strategy selection by the decision maker. This was investigated in a series of three experimental studies which examined the influence of computer based decision aids on decision making strategies. In the three experiments, subjects were given different degrees of support to deal with various components of cognitive effort (processing effort, memory effort and information tracking effort) associated with the strategies applicable to preferential choice problems. The results show that decision makers tend to adapt their strategy selection to the type of decision aids available in such a way as to reduce effort. These results suggest that the assumption that decision makers use a DSS exclusively to maximize decision quality is open to question.

This instrument is intended to be a tool for the study of the initial adoption and eventual diffusion of IT innovations within organizations. While the adoption of information technologies by individuals and organizations has been an area of substantial research interest since the early days of computerization, research efforts to date have led to mixed and inconclusive outcomes. The lack of a theoretical foundation for such research and inadequate definition and measurement of constructs have been identified as major causes for such outcomes. In a recent study examining the diffusion of new end-user IT, we decided to focus on measuring the potential adopters' perceptions of the technology. Measuring such perceptions has been termed a \u201cclassic issue\u201d in the innovation diffusion literature, and a key to integrating the various findings of diffusion research. The perceptions of adopting were initially based on the five characteristics of innovations derived by Rogers (1983) from the diffusion of innovations literature, plus two developed specifically within this study. Of the existing scales for measuring these characteristics, very few had the requisite levels of validity and reliability. For this study, both newly created and existing items were placed in a common pool and subjected to four rounds of sorting by judges to establish which items should be in the various scales. The objective was to verify the convergent and discriminant validity of the scales by examining how the items were sorted into various construct categories. Analysis of inter-judge agreement about item placement identified both bad items as well as weaknesses in some of the constructs' original definitions. These were subsequently redefined. Scales for the resulting constructs were subjected to three separate field tests. Following the final test, the scales all demonstrated acceptable levels of reliability. Their validity was further checked using factor analysis, as well as conducting discriminant analysis comparing responses between adopters and nonadopters of the innovation. The result is a parsimonious, 38-item instrument comprising eight scales which provides a useful tool for the study of the initial adoption and diffusion of innovations.

For many real-time and distributed decision problems, decision-makers face a wide spectrum of information gathering choices that vary in the amount and quality of information as well as their associated costs and delays. Modeling these problems raises several operational and strategic questions including:\n\u2022 how much and what type of information to acquire before making a decision.\n\u2022 what protocol to use for exchanging information among multiple decision-makers.\n\u2022 what organization and information structure (e.g., centralized, coordinated, distributed) to use for effective information sharing and decision-making.\nWe highlight the modeling issues and tradeoffs using examples from production planning, distributed processing, and network routing, and draw upon research in diverse fields, including information economics and game theory, knowledge logic in computer science, and distributed computation, to obtain model specification insights. Our discussions emphasize and illustrate two main model specification themes. First, acquiring additional information often has diminishing returns (in terms of the quality of decisions suggested by the model); therefore, an imprecise model based on partial information might be more appropriate than using a detailed and accurate model that identifies \u2018optimal\u2019 decisions. Concepts from information economics and team theory provide a framework for analyzing this tradeoff. We also briefly discuss some heuristic methods to identify effective information gathering strategies. Our second theme applies to systems consisting of several decision-makers who make interdependent decisions. In this context, the decision model for each agent must be based on an understanding of what information to exchange, how frequently, and what protocol to use for exchanging information. We illustrate how complete information sharing among distributed decision-makers might even be impossible because of a possible dead-lock in decision-making. This game-theoretic phenomenon has implications for designing the organization structure, information systems, and communication protocols to support multi-agent decision-making."}, "2/4/article3": {"year": "1991", "volume": "2", "issue": "4", "title": "Form and Substance in Physical Database Design: An Empirical Study", "authors": ["Michael J.

Thirteen subjects each solved two physical database design problems: five subjects were experienced designers; eight were graduate students with little or no actual design experience, though they were exposed to the principles of design through course-work. For each problem, subjects were presented with a list of available problem information (hardware, content, and activity data) and were directed to generate a physical design (record structures and access paths) that would minimize retrieval time and storage space. All sessions were audiotaped. Three types of data were incorporated for the analysis: information acquisition patterns, solution generation patterns, and verbal protocol. It was hypothesized that database design reasoning embodies forms of deliberation to reduce problem-solving complexity and that these forms resemble those found in other design problem-solving studies\u2014commonality of task environmental demands will result in commonality in problem-solving methods in response to those demands. In particular, we expected to find specific control strategies, the use of hierarchical abstraction, the use of problem-specific heuristics, and the use of qualtitative reasoning with mental models of dynamic components of the task. Our results indicate that these forms are indeed present and of significant value in physical database design problem solving. Experience played a significant role in determining both the form and substance of reasoning used in physical database design. Both experienced and inexperienced database designers exhibited at least some of these forms of reasoning. Experienced designers, however, effectively applied these forms, demonstrating a substance of reasoning, although their methods of application varied considerably. The least experienced designers did not effectively apply these forms and, lost in the detail of the design problems, were unable to generate reasonable designs. It is concluded that recognition of appropriate reasoning forms and the effective application of these forms are critical to developing efficient physical database designs.

To deal with this problem, he called for systems that could filter and condense data so that only relevant information reached the decision maker. The potential for information overload is especially critical in text-based information. The purpose of this research is to investigate the effects and theoretical limitations of extract condensing as a text processing tool in terms of recipient performance. In the experiment described here, an environment is created in which the effects of text condensing are isolated from the effects of message and individual recipient differences. The data show no difference in reading comprehension performance between the condensed forms and the original document. This indicates that condensed forms can be produced that are equally as informative as the original document. These results suggest that it is possible to apply a relatively simple computer algorithm to text and produce extracts that capture enough of the information contained in the original document so that the recipient can perform as if he or she had read the original.

The scarcity of new employees, the difficulty of training and a high turnover make personnel management in these areas a difficult problem. For IS employees, the relationships between job satisfaction, organizational commitment and intention to leave the organization have been established. Because the size of the investment and the number of organizations establishing IC organizations are growing dramatically, it has become important to understand the determinants of turnover intentions for IC as well as IS employees. Are IC employees similar to their IS counterparts? Or, is their nature basically different, as some studies have suggested? This study examines the differences between IS and IC employees in terms of demographic characteristics, participation on boundary spanning activities, role stressors, overall job satisfaction, organizational commitment and turnover intentions. The differences are found to be significant and call for special attention from IC managers to manage more properly their personnel resources. IC employees were found to participate more extensively in boundary spanning activities, experienced more role stressors (role ambiguity and role conflict), were less satisfied with their jobs and less committed to their organization. The findings also demonstrate the importance of organizational commitment as an intervening variable in models of turnover.

Six years of historical data on IT investment and performance were collected for 33 valve manufacturing firms from the CEO, the controller and the production manager in each firm. Investment was perceptually categorized by management objective (i.e., strategic, informational and transactional) and tested against four measures of performance (sales growth, return on assets, and two measures of labor productivity). Heavy use of transactional IT investment was found to be significantly and consistently associated with strong firm performance over the six years studied. Heavy use of strategic IT was found to be neutral in the long term and associated only with relatively poorly performing firms in the short term. This study suggests that early adopters of strategic IT could have spectacular success but once the technology becomes common, the competitive advantage is lost. In addition, the context of the firm was included in the analysis. Conversion effectiveness, which measures the quality of the firm-wide management and commitment to IT, was found to be a significant moderator between strategic IT investment and firm performance."}, "3/4/article2": {"year": "1992", "volume": "3", "issue": "4", "title": "Diffusion of Information Technology Outsourcing: Influence Sources and the Kodak Effect", "authors": ["Lawrence LohSloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139", "N.

IS development projects are often over-budget, late, costly to maintain, and not done to the satisfaction of the requesting user. These problems exist, in part, due to the organization of the IS development process, where information systems development is typically assigned by the user (principal) to a systems developer (agent). These two parties do not have perfectly congruent goals, and therefore a contract is developed to specify their relationship. An inability to directly monitor the agent requires the use of performance measures, or metrics, to represent the agent's actions to the principal. The use of multiple measures is necessary given the multi-dimensional nature of successful systems development. In practice such contracts are difficult to develop satisfactorily, due in part to an inability to specify appropriate metrics. This paper develops a principal-agent model that provides a set of decision criteria for the principal to use to develop an incentive compatible contract for the agent. These criteria include the precision and the sensitivity of the performance metric. After presenting the formal model, some current software development metrics are discussed to illustrate how the model can be used to provide a theoretical foundation and a formal vocabulary for performance metric analysis. The model is also used in a positive (descriptive) manner to explain why current practice emphasizes metrics that possess relatively high levels of sensitivity and precision.

This paper proposes a technique for reconciling knowledge in two independent knowledge bases, describes a working program built to implement that technique, and discusses an exploratory study for validating the technique. The technique is based on the use of heuristics for identifying and resolving discrepancies between the knowledge bases. Each heuristic developed provides detection and resolution procedures for a distinct variety of discrepancy in the knowledge bases. Sample discrepancies include using synonyms for the same term, conflicting rules, and extra reasoning steps. Discrepancies are detected and resolved through the use of circumstantial evidence available from the knowledge bases themselves and by asking sharply focussed questions to the experts responsible for the knowledge bases. The technique was tested on two independently developed knowledge bases designed to aid novice statisticians in diagnosing problems in linear regression models. The heuristics located a significant number of the discrepancies between the knowledge bases and assisted the experts in creating a consensus knowledge base for diagnosing multicollinearity problems. We argue that the task of identifying discrepancies between independent bodies of knowledge is an inevitable part of any large knowledge acquisition effort. Hence the heuristics developed in this work are applicable even when knowledge acquisition is not done by reconciling two complete knowledge bases. We also suggest that our approach can be extended to other knowledge representations such as frames and database schemas, and speculate about its potential application to other domains involving the reconciliation of knowledge, such as requirements determination, negotiation, and design."}, "4/4/article1": {"year": "1993", "volume": "4", "issue": "4", "title": "Editorial Notes", "authors": ["John Leslie KingUniversity of California, Irvine", "E.

Still fewer have advanced a theoretical perspective on possible cultural effects. In a world moving rapidly toward corporate multinationalism, this oversight seems notable. As foreign managers locate plants and offices in the U.S. and as American managers establish foreign subsidiaries and offices abroad, it is important for these managers to know in advance as much as possible about the impact of culture on technological innovation. Japan and the U.S. are cases in point. Both have subsidiaries and actively market goods and services in the other country, far flung enterprises for which IT seems to be a natural coordinating mechanism. Yet while U.S. companies exploit the advantages of IT such as E-mail, Japanese firms do not. The Japanese, however, do utilize FAX extensively. Culture is one fruitful explanation for these differences. To examine these two markedly different cultures and the effect of these differences on technological innovation, a large Japanese airline and financial institution were chosen as representative Asian sites. The IT experiences of 209 Japanese knowledge workers are contrasted with those of 711 knowledge workers in comparable firms in the United States on certain dimensions. Using Hofstede's work on culture and social presence/information richness theory as grounding, it was hypothesized that high uncertainty avoidance in Japan and structural features of the Japanese written language could explain Japanese perceptions about new work technologies such as E-Mail and FAX. Furthermore, the theoretical conceptualization in the paper attempts to account for Japanese departures from the U.S. experience. Results from empirical tests verified many, but not all of the predicted differences between Japanese and American knowledge workers.

First, long-established intellectual perspectives on innovation from neoclassical economics and organization theory are inadequate to explain the dynamics of actual innovative change in the IT domain. A broader view adopted from economic history and the new institutionalism in sociology provides a stronger base for understanding the role of institutions in IT innovation. Second, institutional intervention in IT innovation can be constructed at the intersection of the influence and regulatory powers of institutions and the ideologies of supply-push and demand-pull models of innovation.

In addition, complex commands are also prevalent where specification of commands is strictly separated from multiple, independent implementations as in open software standards.\nOur approach is based on an inheritance structure known as a command lattice. Like other forms of inheritance, command lattices support incremental definition and abbreviation of specifications. Because a complete command lattice can have a large number of specifications, we develop another structure known as a minimal command tree in which a command lattice is derived from a much smaller number of independent specifications. To map from a minimal command tree to a command lattice, we present algorithms that materialize an arbitrary node of a command lattice and compactly generate the behavior of a command lattice. To demonstrate the potential of command lattices, we have implemented a set of tools that provide convenient specification and powerful reasoning capabilities. Our tool collection includes the Command Specification Language that supports a precise and rich specification of the structural and behavioral properties of commands, the incremental definition tool that ensures consistency of command lattices, the browsing tool that displays a command's inheritance structure, the type checker that ensures structural consistency of commands in expressions, and the target system tracer that simulates a sequence of command executions.

The computing resource is represented by a queueing model, and it is assumed there is no access to external information processing markets by either users or the IS department. A mechanism design approach is used. We derive conditions that the optimal mechanism must satisfy; the first-order conditions of the full-information problem generalize in a clear way with the virtual marginal cost replacing the full information marginal capacity cost. The consequences of the information asymmetry include reduced capacity, arrival rate and utilization rate, and higher prices and mean waiting time compared to the full-information solution. Thus the organization suffers losses due not only to the IS manager's informational rent, but also to the opportunity cost of jobs not served. The revelation principle guarantees that the resulting mechanism is at least as good as a profit center, as well as outperforming any other centralized method of control. The mechanism design approach is also shown to be robust with respect to uncertainty on the part of the central management about the degree of incentive conflict with the IS manager.

According to Social Cognitive Theory, watching others performing a behavior, in this case interacting with a computer system, influences the observers' perceptions of their own ability to perform the behavior, or self-efficacy, and the expected outcomes that they perceive, as well as providing strategies for effective performance. The findings provide only partial support for the research model. Self-efficacy exerted a strong influence on performance in both models. In addition, behavior modeling was found to be more effective than the traditional method for training in Lotus 1-2-3, resulting in higher self-efficacy and higher performance. For WordPerfect, however, modeling did not significantly influence performance. This finding was unexpected, and several possible explanations are explored in the discussion. Of particular surprise were the negative relationships found between outcome expectations and performance. Outcome expectations were expected to positively influence performance, but the results indicated a strong negative effect. Measurement limitations are presented as the most plausible explanation for this result, but further research is necessary to provide conclusive explanations."}, "6/2/article3": {"year": "1995", "volume": "6", "issue": "2", "title": "Understanding Information Technology Usage: A Test of Competing Models", "authors": ["Shirley TaylorSchool of Business, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada K7L 3N6", "Peter A.

Two types of coordination mechanisms were considered: vertical and horizontal. The former refers to the extent to which coordination between users and IS staff is undertaken by authorized entities such as project managers or steering committees. The latter refers to the extent to which coordination is undertaken through mutual adjustments and communications between users and IS staff. A new research model was developed by synthesizing research using the structural contingency perspective from Organization Theory and the risk-based perspective in Software Engineering. The model suggests that residual performance risk, i.e., the difficulty in estimating performance-related outcomes during the later stages of the project, can clarify the relationship between project uncertainty, coordination mechanisms and performance. Eight hypotheses were derived from the model for empirical testing. Data were collected from 64 software development projects in the banking and other industries. The results provide considerable support for a revised research model. As expected, project uncertainty increases residual performance risk. Both in turn have a direct negative effect on performance. Vertical coordination significantly reduces both project uncertainty and residual performance risk. However, horizontal coordination does not have any significant effect on residual performance risk. Instead, it has a direct positive effect on project performance. Moreover, higher levels of both vertical and horizontal coordination lead to higher levels of overall performance.

We study design differences in inductive expert systems arising from implicit versus explicit handling of input noise. Most previous approaches use an implicit approach wherein inductive expert systems are constructed using input data of quality comparable to problems the system will be called upon to solve. We develop an explicit algorithm (ID3ecp) that uses a clean (without input errors) training set and an explicit measure of the input noise level and compare it to a traditional implicit algorithm, ID3p (the ID3 algorithm with the pessimistic pruning procedure). The novel feature of the explicit algorithm is that it injects noise in a controlled rather than random manner in order to reduce the performance variance due to noise. We show analytically that the implicit algorithm has the same expected partitioning behavior as the explicit algorithm. In contrast, however, the partitioning behavior of the explicit algorithm is shown to be more stable (i.e., lower variance) than the implicit algorithm. To extend the analysis to the predictive performance of the algorithms, a set of simulation experiments is described in which the average performance and coefficient of variation of performance of both algorithms are studied on real and artificial data sets.

I ground this perspective in an empirical study which examined the use of a new information technology within one organization over a two-year period. In this organization, a series of subtle but nonetheless significant changes were enacted over time as organizational actors appropriated the new technology into their work practices, and then experimented with local innovations, responded to unanticipated breakdowns and contingencies, initiated opportunistic shifts in structure and coordination mechanisms, and improvised various procedural, cognitive, and normative variations to accommodate their evolving use of the technology. These findings provide the empirical basis for a practice-based perspective on organizational transformation. Because it is grounded in the micro-level changes that actors enact over time as they make sense of and act in the world, a practice lens can avoid the strong assumptions of rationality, determinism, or discontinuity characterizing existing change perspectives.

In North County, participants considered GIS to be responsible for transforming the way that work was accomplished and for changing patterns of communication among departments. In South County, the same GIS technology was implemented with little social consequence. These divergent outcomes are associated with differences in four specific processes related to the implementation of the GIS in the two organizations: initiation, transition, deployment, and spread of knowledge. In North County, implementation was initiated by an influential group of users (geographers) who positioned the technology as a shared resource that built upon existing competencies. A distributed configuration was deployed in North County, and conceptual knowledge about GIS was disseminated widely. By contrast, in South County GIS was initiated by a centralized data processing department as one of many revenue-producing services. Transition to GIS in South County required a departure from existing competencies, and it was deployed as a centralized system with limited procedural knowledge spread among the potential user community.

This transition may not actually occur for a variety of reasons. Two tests are performed of the feasibility and the desirability of transitions to new markets. In the first test, traders in a series of economic experiments demonstrate an ability to make a transition and develop a critical mass of trading activity in a newly opened market. In the second test, simulation is used to compare the floor-based specialist auction in place in most U.S. stock exchanges today to a disintermediated alternative employing screen-based order matching. The results indicate that reducing the role of dealer-intermediaries can actually diminish important measures of market quality. Our findings suggest that the low trading volumes on many off-exchange systems do not result from traders' inability to break away from established trading floors. Rather, today's off-exchange trading systems are not uniformly superior to the trading mechanisms of traditional exchanges.

Recent work formally contrasted the expressive power of these two approaches, termed temporally ungrouped and temporally grouped, and demonstrated that the temporally grouped models are more expressive. In the temporally ungrouped models, the temporal dimension is added through the addition of some number of distinguished attributes to the schema of each relation, and each tuple is \u201cstamped\u201d with temporal values for these attributes. By contrast, in temporally grouped models the temporal dimension is added to the types of values that serve as the domain of each ordinary attribute, and the application's schema is left intact.

IDEA employs constraint posting to initially bound the design space and to maintain consistency of the design solutions. Case-based reasoning allows IDEA to generate new designs by retrieving, adapting, and composing from similar cases in memory. Finally, IDEA optimizes multiple objectives to identify a set of pareto-optimal designs. By organizing computer memory as a collection of cases and case snippets, and by adapting and synthesizing those cases and snippets\u2014using techniques similar to those employed by design experts\u2014IDEA provides valuable design assistance.

However, the evidence of payoff from such investments can be classified as mixed as best, a problem we partly attribute to the absence of a strong theoretical foundation to assess and analyze reengineering projects. We seek to apply complementarity theory and a business value modeling approach to address some questions involving what, when, and how much to reengineer. Complementarity theory is based on the notion that the value of having more of one factor increases by having more of another complementary factor. Further, related developments in the optimization of \u201csupermodular\u201d functions provide a useful way to maximize net benefits by exploiting complementary relationships between variables of interest. Combining this theory with a multi-level business value model showing relationships between key performance measures and their drivers, we argue that organizational payoff is maximized when several factors relating to IT, decision authority, business processes and incentives are changed in a coordinated manner in the right directions by the right magnitude to move toward an ideal design configuration. Our analysis further shows that when a complementary reengineering variable is left unchanged either due to myopic vision or self-interest, the organization will not be able to obtain the full benefits of reengineering due to smaller optimal changes in the other variables. We also show that by increasing the cost of changing the levels of design variables, unfavorable pre-existing conditions (e.g., too much heterogeneity in the computing environment) can lead to reengineering changes of smaller magnitude than in a setting with favorable conditions."}, "7/4/article4": {"year": "1996", "volume": "7", "issue": "4", "title": "Facilitation, GSS, and Training as Sources of Process Restrictiveness and Guidance for Structured Group Decision Making: An Empirical Assessment", "authors": ["Bradley C.

The case study findings suggest that a configuration of four variables characterizes a business unit context conducive to decentralized systems development governance (organic decision-making, high business unit autonomy, a differentiation competitive strategy, and an unstable industry environment). As predicted, however, the influence of these variables is likely to be overridden and a \u201cdeviant\u201d solution adopted when deficiencies in IT capabilities are perceived and there is a culture that supports structural change at the business unit level. Additional interview and survey data collected from the key stakeholders are then analyzed in order to develop a richer understanding of the dimensions of the IT capabilities construct at the business unit level. The notion of absorptive capacity provides a theoretical argument for the emergent findings. Implications for researching today's increasingly complex IS governance forms are then drawn."}, "8/1/article5": {"year": "1997", "volume": "8", "issue": "1", "title": "Measuring Software Engineering Evolution: A Rasch Calibration", "authors": ["Sasa DeklevaCollege of Commerce, DePaul University, 1 East Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604-2287", "David DrehmerCollege of Commerce, DePaul University, 1 East Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604-2287"], "keywords": ["  measurement and scaling ", " software process maturity ", " software process evolution ", " Rasch model ", " software productivity ", " software quality ", " risks "], "abstract": "This investigation provides an empirical scaling of software engineering practices derived from the software process maturity model developed by the Software Engineering Institute of Carnegie Mellon University (Humphrey et al.

Drawing upon the transaction costs economics, organization theory and information systems literatures, we hypothese three sets of key influences: (1) factors exogenous to the relationship, i.e., the characteristics of the environment within which the relationship operates, and factors endogeneous to the relationship including (2) economic and behavioral characteristics of the relationship, and (3) interorganizational information technology applications. These factors have been independently examined in separate research streams. A key contribution of this study is therefore to conceptually and empirically capture their collective influence on cooperation.\nWe empirically test the five hypotheses we develop within the context of buyer-supplier relationships in the U.S. and Japanese automobile industries. Multiple regressions conducted on a data set of 447 distinct relationships indicate that the relational characteristics (i.e., the behavioral climate of the relationship) are the most robust predictor of cooperation in both countries when compared with other structural (e.g., asset specificity) or technological factors (use of EDI\u2014electronic data interchange). Environmental uncertainty (i.e., technological unpredictability) is positively associated with cooperation in Japanese supplier relations, which suggests that cooperation can act as an uncertainty absorption mechanism. Governance structure is a strong and significant predictor of cooperation in both samples, but with the opposite sign. Similarly, information technology (IT) does not play the same predictive role in the two country samples. Significant only in Japan it reflects an \u2018electronic partnership\u2019 approach to the use of IT in supplier relations."}, "8/2/article2": {"year": "1997", "volume": "8", "issue": "2", "title": "Business Strategic Orientation, Information Systems Strategic Orientation, and Strategic Alignment", "authors": ["Yolande E.

In this paper, control is viewed broadly, encompassing all attempts to ensure individuals in organizations act in a manner that is consistent with meeting organizational goals and objectives. Control is categorized into formal modes (behavioral, outcome) and informal modes (clan, self). Formal and informal control modes are implemented via a variety of mechanisms, such as linking pay with performance, socialization, and team-building. Relatively little is known about the modes of control used to manage information systems development efforts. The objective of this research is to address this lack of understanding in the literature by exploring how control modes are implemented during systems development projects and by investigating why IS and user stakeholders implement particular combinations of control modes. To meet this objective, a series of four case studies of systems development projects was conducted. The results reveal that users, as well as IS managers, play a critical role in controlling systems development projects. Moreover, the results suggest that all stakeholders implement a portfolio of control modes that typically includes both formal and informal modes. This portfolio contains a mix of overlapping and redundant mechanisms used to exercise these modes of control. The results also suggest that constructing a portfolio of control modes is a process that includes selecting appropriate preexisting mechanisms of formal control; designing new mechanisms with which to implement formal control, if necessary; and supplementing the mechanisms of formal control with mechanisms of informal control. Throughout this process of construction, the choice of particular control mechanisms depends on task characteristics, role expectations, and project-related knowledge and skills."}, "8/3/article2": {"year": "1997", "volume": "8", "issue": "3", "title": "A Respecification and Extension of the DeLone and McLean Model of IS Success", "authors": ["Peter B.

The process is a simplification of a complex, parallel-machine production scheduling task performed in a local manufacturing firm. The system, Dispatcher-Soar, generally supports a symbolic, constraint propagation approach based, in part, on the reasoning methods of the human scheduler at the firm. The implementation of this process is based on a dispatching rule used by the expert. The behavior of Dispatcher-Soar centered around a small case study examining the effects of scheduling volume and learning on performance. Results indicated that the knowledge gained can reduce within-trial scheduling effort. An analysis of the generated knowledge structures (chunks) provided insight into how that learning was accomplished and contributed to process improvements.

In our analysis we define an electronic network as a set of participants and a portfolio of assets. The salient concept in this perspective is the degree to which network participants are indispensable in making network assets productive. We derive three main results. First, if one or more assets are essential to all network participants, then all the assets should be owned together. Second, participants that are indispensable to an asset essential to all participants should own all network assets. Third and most important, in the absence of an indispensable participant, and as long as the cooperation of at least two participants is necessary to create value, sole ownership is never the best form of ownership for an electronic network. This latter result implies that as the leading network participants become more dispensable, we should see an evolution toward forms of joint ownership."}, "8/4/article2": {"year": "1997", "volume": "8", "issue": "4", "title": "Advancing the Theory of Adaptive Structuration: The Development of a Scale to Measure Faithfulness of Appropriation", "authors": ["Wynne W.

Thus, an important research issue involves strategies for facilitating EDI adoption. We analyze the introduction of an EDI system in a vertical market involving one manufacturer and two suppliers. The manufacturer initiates an EDI network, and penalizes a supplier for not joining the system by reducing its volume of business with the supplier. Along with a \u201cstick,\u201d the manufacturer can also use a \u201ccarrot\u201d in the form of a subsidy to partially offset a supplier's setup cost.\nThe competition between the suppliers is characterized by incentive types for joining the EDI system (\u201cmotivating\u201d or \u201cthreatening\u201d) and the Information Technology (IT) efficiency (\u201cefficient\u201d or \u201cinefficient\u201d). We show that regardless of its cost structure, a supplier may have to join the EDI network out of \u201cstrategic necessity,\u201d due to the presence of an IT-efficient supplier. Our analysis further shows that depending on the supplier competition structure, the EDI system may prove to be a \u201cbeneficial\u201d strategic necessity for a large supplier and an \u201cunfortunate\u201d strategic necessity for a small supplier. Another key result is that by increasing the severity of the penalty, both the manufacturer and the follower supplier can be worse off under certain conditions. The analysis of subsidy strategies reveals that unless leadership and followership positions are reversed due to a subsidy, subsidizing a supplier has no impact on the joining time of its competitor. Thus the EDI initiator cannot induce both suppliers to join earlier by subsidizing one supplier. Also, the larger the slack capacity of the leader, the higher (lower) the manufacturer's incentive to subsidize the leader (follower).

Despite the system development method employed, the functional success of many aspects of requirements determination ultimately rests on how well the user(s) and analyst(s) communicate (Holtzblatt and Beyer 1995). The purpose of this paper is to report the results obtain from a laboratory experiment that investigated the effects of a semantic structuring process of inquiry on the process of interview-derived information acquisition and the subsequent overall correctness of the logical representation of the facts obtained. The study focused on the specific question types used by systems analysts and the role their semantic construction played in representing the information flows in a business system. Three underlying semantic patterns of questions emerged from the analysis. The results showed that certain question types were associated with increased accuracy of logical representations regardless of analyst experience level. Further, the semantic and process patterns that emerged were also directly related to accurate representation of facts and demonstrated an experience-level independence.

This research has been primarily concerned with suggesting features/components of modeling environments such as improved executable modeling languages for model creation, integration, and data representation; specialized database systems for managing model data; and customized model-solver software. However, there has been little (if any) empirical guidance offered in the literature about the specific needs of business and industry for computer-based integrated modeling environments. Using a data set compiled from a national survey of modelers (analysts) and model users (decision makers), we empirically investigate the validity of several of the key assumptions of modeling environment research reported in the literature, and examine the relationships between the modeling factors: data complexity, model complexity, modeling intensity, modeler/user requirements, and need for computer-based integrated modeling environments in organizations.\nOur empirical analysis of the data set shows that practitioners rank automated access to model data and automated error checking (e.g., model syntax and semantics checking) high as desirable components in modeling environments. We find that users prefer to have modeling environments linked to their current modeling and modeling-support software systems. Our findings further suggest that a high percentage of modelers and users are dissatisfied with the software systems they are currently using to support their modeling activities. Finally, a covariance structure analysis of the modeling environment factors clearly shows that: (a) model complexity has a direct positive effect on modeling intensity; (b) data complexity has an insignificant direct effect on modeling intensity, but has a negative effect on modeler/user requirements; and (c) modeler/user requirements have a direct positive effect on need for computer-based integrated modeling environments in organizations."}, "9/1/article5": {"year": "1998", "volume": "9", "issue": "1", "title": "The Impact of Information Technology Investments on Firm Performance and Evaluation: Evidence from Newly Industrialized Economies", "authors": ["Kar Yan TamDepartment of Information and Systems Management, School of Business and Management, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong"], "keywords": ["  Information Technology ", " Computers ", " Investment ", " Performance ", " Valuation ", " Economics ", " Business Value "], "abstract": "The impact of information technology (IT) investments on firm performance has been the subject of active research in recent years.

First, IT investment is not correlated with shareholder's return. Second, there is little evidence that the level of computerization is valued by the market in developed and newly-developed countries. Third, there is no consistent measurement of IT investment as indicated by the mixed results across different performance ratios.

An economic model is first presented that incorporates the incentive structures for governments, software publishers, and individual consumers. The analytical model provides the economic rationale for the reluctance of a number of governments to aggressively enact and enforce intellectual property rights. An important proposition derived from the analysis states that the government's incentive to enact and enforce copyright laws are closely related to the size of the domestic software industry. The ensuing empirical study provides support for the proposition and further suggests that this relationship holds regardless of the income levels of the countries. Our analysis reveals that alliances between foreign and domestic software publishers through product relationships can be mutually beneficial and will provide an environment of increased copyright enforcement. These results provide a viable strategy to combat global software piracy. With strong policies on copyright enforcement, and a vigorous promotion of alliances between foreign and domestic publishers, a government can increase the net welfare of the country and help establish a strong domestic software industry. Through product relationships with domestic publishers, a foreign publisher can improve profits and operate in an environment of increased intellectual property protection. We then present a general model of ethical behavior related to the impact of behavioral and cultural factors on software piracy. The purpose of this model is to examine whether these determinants of piracy behavior are supranational and transcend cultural and ethical barriers.

This paper makes three important contributions in this context: (1) it provides a formal theoretical grounding for the validity of the Black-Scholes option pricing model in the context of the spectrum of capital budgeting methods that might be employed to assess IT investments; (2) it shows why the assumptions of both the Black-Scholes and the binomial option pricing models place constraints on the range of IT investment situations that one can evaluate that are similar to those implied by traditional capital budgeting methods such as discounted cash flow analysis; and (3) it presents the first application of the Black-Scholes model that uses a real world business situation involving IT as its test bed. Our application focuses on an analysis of the timing of the deployment of point-of-sale (POS) debit services by the Yankee 24 shared electronic banking network of New England. This application enables us to make the case for the generalizability of the approach we discuss to four IT investment settings."}, "10/1/article5": {"year": "1999", "volume": "10", "issue": "1", "title": "Nonlinear and Noncompensatory Models in User Information Satisfaction Measurement", "authors": ["Vikram SethiCIS Department, Southwest Missouri State University, Springfield, Missouri 65804", "Ruth C.

Several instruments have been developed in the literature to measure user information satisfaction (UIS). These instruments measure user satisfaction by asking respondents to rate their satisfaction/dissatisfaction with a variety of IS attributes; e.g., EDP services, EDP staff, information product, and involvement in IS development. These responses are then combined linearly to develop a surrogate measure for UIS satisfaction. This linear model is derived from Anderson's information theory (Anderson 1981) and based on the assumption that each attribute judgment has a conditionally monotone relationship with the UIS evaluation. However, the literature on attitude formation and decision making suggests that other nonlinear and noncompensatory models are available to decision makers for combining information and are used frequently in attitude formation. In this study, we use two sets of data to examine the linear model and five nonlinear models of decision making to evaluate whether nonlinear models are more effective in predicting a user's overall satisfaction with information systems. First, responses from faculty members at an academic institution were used to test each model. All the nonlinear models were more efficient predictors than the linear models. In addition, two nonlinear models\u2014the multiplicative and the scatter models\u2014best represented the data with square multiple correlations of 0.69 and 0.68, as compared to the linear model which had an R 2 of 0.61. Second, data from a previous study (Galletta and Lederer 1989) were analyzed to examine whether nonlinear models were more efficient. Data for this study were collected using the short version of the Bailey and Pearson (1983) UIS instrument.

The results of the experiment showed that overall, groups using nominal brainstorming significantly outperformed groups using the other three brainstorming approaches. Further, even under conditions thought to be favorable to EBS, nominal brainstorming groups were at least as productive as EBS groups. The paper explains these results by suggesting that the process gains of EBS may not be as large as expected and that the presence of four additional process losses inherent to EBS technologies impair its productivity. It is also argued that the prevailing popularity of group brainstorming (verbal or electronic) in organizations may be explained by the perceived productivity of those approaches.

When this happens, the observed pattern of cumulative adoptions will vary depending on which event in the assimilation process (i.e., acquisition or deployment) is treated as the adoption event. Instead of mirroring one another, a widening gap\u2014termed here an assimilation gap\u2014will exist between the cumulative adoption curves associated with the alternatively conceived adoption events. When a pronounced assimilation gap exists, the common practice of using cumulative purchases or acquisitions as the basis for diffusion modeling can present an illusory picture of the diffusion process\u2014leading to potentially erroneous judgments about the robustness of the diffusion process already observed, and of the technology's future prospects. Researchers may draw inappropriate theoretical inferences about the forces driving diffusion. Practitioners may commit to a technology based on a belief that pervasive adoption is inevitable, when it is not.\nThis study introduces the assimilation gap concept, and develops a general operational measure derived from the difference between the cumulative acquisition and deployment patterns. It describes how two characteristics\u2014increasing returns to adoption and knowledge barriers impeding adoption\u2014separately and in combination may serve to predispose a technology to exhibit a pronounced gap. It develops techniques for measuring assimilation gaps, for establishing whether two gaps are significantly different from each other, and for establishing whether a particular gap is absolutely large enough to be of substantive interest. Finally, it demonstrates these techniques in an analysis of adoption data for three prominent innovations in software process technology\u2014relational database management systems (RDBs), general purpose fourth generation languages (4GLs), and computer aided software engineering tools (CASE). The analysis confirmed that assimilation gaps can be sensibly measured, and that their measured size is largely consistent with a priori expectations and recent research results. A very pronounced gap was found for CASE, while more moderate\u2014though still significant\u2014gaps were found for RDBs and 4GLs.\nThese results have the immediate implication that, where the possibility of a substantial assimilation gap exists, the time of deployment should be captured instead of, or in addition to, time of acquisition as the basis for diffusion modeling. More generally, the results suggest that observers be guarded about concluding, based on sales data, that an innovation is destined to become widely used. In addition, by providing the ability to analyze and compare assimilation gaps, this study provides an analytic foundation for future research on why assimilation gaps occur, and what might be done to reduce them."}, "10/3/article4": {"year": "1999", "volume": "10", "issue": "3", "title": "Research Report.

We begin by presenting a conceptual model of the assessment of user competence to organize and clarify the diverse literature regarding what user competence means and the problems of assessment. As an illustrative study, we then report the findings from an experiment involving 66 participants. The experiment was conducted to compare empirically two methods (paper and pencil tests versus self-report questionnaire), across two different types of software, or domains of knowledge (word processing versus spreadsheet packages), and two different conceptualizations of competence (software knowledge versus self-efficacy). The analysis shows statistical significance in all three main effects. How user competence is measured, what is measured, what measurement context is employed:all influence the measurement outcome. Furthermore, significant interaction effects indicate that different combinations of measurement methods, conceptualization, and knowledge domains produce different results. The concept of frame of reference, and its anchoring effect on subjects' responses, explains a number of these findings. The study demonstrates the need for clarity in both defining what type of competence is being assessed and in drawing conclusions regarding competence, based upon the types of measures used.

These databases provide timely information for delay sensitive users. The proposed approach allows diverse users to optimize their own objectives while collectively maximizing organizational benefits. We rely on economic principles to derive priority prices by modeling the fixed-capacity real-time database environment as an economic system. Each priority is associated with a price and a delay, and the price is the premium (congestion toll resulting from negative externalities) for accessing the database. At optimality, the prices are equal to the aggregate delay cost imposed on all other users of the database. These priority prices are used to control admission and to schedule user jobs in the database system. The database monitors the arrival processes and the state of the system, and incrementally adjusts the prices to regulate the flow. Because our model ignores the operational intricacies of the real-time databases (e.g., intermediate queues at the CPU and disks, memory size, etc.) to maintain analytical tractability, we evaluate the performance of our pricing approach through simulation. We evaluate the database performance using both the traditional real-time database performance metrics (e.g., the number of jobs serviced on time, average tardiness) and the economic benefits (e.g., benefits to the organization). The simulation results, under various database workload parameters, show that our priority pricing mechanism not only maximizes organizational benefits but also outperforms in all aspects of traditional performance measures compared to frequently used database scheduling techniques, such as first-come-first-served, earliest deadline first and least slack first."}, "11/2/article6": {"year": "2000", "volume": "11", "issue": "2", "title": "Innovation and Control in Standards Architectures: The Rise and Fall of Japan's PC-98", "authors": ["Joel WestCenter for Research on Information Technology and Organizations (CRITO), University of California, Irvine, 3200 Berkeley Place, Irvine, California 92697\u20134650", "Jason DedrickCenter for Research on Information Technology and Organizations (CRITO), University of California, Irvine, 3200 Berkeley Place, Irvine, California 92697\u20134650"], "keywords": ["  standards competition ", " computer architecture ", " application programming interface ", " network externalities ", " personal computers ", " Japan "], "abstract": "For more than a decade NEC dominated the Japanese PC market with its PC-98 architecture, which was incompatible both with its major Japanese rivals and the global PC standard.

Many enhancement cost-reduction initiatives have focused on increasing software structure in applications. However, while software structure can decrease enhancement effort by localizing data processing, increased effort is also required to comprehend structure. Thus, it is not clear whether high levels of software structure are economically efficient in all situations. In this study, we develop a model of the relationship between software structure and software enhancement costs and errors. We introduce the notion of software structure as a moderator of the relationship between software volatility, total data complexity, and software enhancement outcomes. We posit that it is efficient to more highly structure the more volatile applications, because increased familiarity with the application structure through frequent enhancement enables localization of maintenance effort. For more complex applications, software structure is more beneficial than for less complex applications because it facilitates the comprehension process where it is most needed. Given the downstream enhancement benefits of structure for more volatile and complex applications, we expect that the optimal level of structure is higher for these applications. We empirically evaluate our model using data collected on the business applications of a major mass merchandiser and a large commercial bank. We find that structure moderates the relationship between complexity, volatility, and enhancement outcomes, such that higher levels of structure are more advantageous for the more complex and more volatile applications in terms of reduced enhancement costs and errors. We also find that more structure is designed in for volatile applications and for applications with higher levels of complexity. Finally, we identify application type as a significant factor in predicting which applications are more volatile and more complex at our research sites. That is, applications with induction-based algorithms such as those that support planning, forecasting, and management decision-making activities are more complex and more volatile than applications with rule-based algorithms that support operational and transaction-processing activities.

We identify conditions under which an entrant will launch a next generation product thereby preventing the incumbent from employing a protection strategy. We define a capabilities advantage as the ability to develop and launch a next generation product at a lower cost than a competitor, and a product with a greater market response is one with greater profit flows.

The results suggest that e-commerce initiatives do indeed lead to significant positive CARs for firms' shareholders.

We suggest that strategic business planning for network services would benefit from a systems thinking approach that analyzes the feedback effects present in the underlying business process. These feedback loops can be complex and have significant impact on business performance. For instance, while the size of a provider's customer base depends on price and network performance, network performance is itself dependent on the size of the customer base. In this paper, we develop a planning model that represents these feedback effects using the finite difference equations methodology of systems dynamics. The model is validated by showing its fit with essential characteristics of the underlying problem domain, and by showing its ability to replicate observed reference mode behaviors. Simulations are then carried out under a variety of scenarios to examine issues important to service providers. Among other findings, the simulations suggest that (a) under flat-rate pricing, lowering price to increase customer base can hurt profitability as well as network performance; (b) under usage-based pricing, lowering price need not necessarily lead to a larger customer base; and (c) in addition to price, the customers' threshold of tolerance for performance degradation plays a significant role in balancing market share with profitability.

However, from anecdotal evidence and case studies it is difficult to evaluate whether online social structures are subject to the same problems as traditional social structures. Drawing from prior studies of traditional social structures and empirical analyses of longitudinal data from a sample of Internet-based groups, this exploratory work considers the role of size and communication activity in sustainable online social structures.\nA resource-based theory of sustainable social structures is presented. Members contribute time, energy, and other resources, enabling a social structure to provide benefits for individuals. These benefits, which include information, influence, and social support, are the basis for a social structure's ability to attract and retain members. This model focuses on the system of opposing forces that link membership size as a component of resource availability and communication activity as an aspect of benefit provision to the sustainability of an online social structure. Analyses of data from a random sample of e-mail-based Internet social structures (listservs) indicate that communication activity and size have both positive and negative effects on a structure's sustainability. These results suggest that while the use of networked communication technologies may alter the form of communication, balancing the opposing impacts of membership size and communication activity in order to maintain resource availability and provide benefits for current members remains a fundamental problem underlying the development of sustainable online social structures."}, "12/4/article3": {"year": "2001", "volume": "12", "issue": "4", "title": "Membership Size, Communication Activity, and Sustainability: A Resource-Based Model of Online Social Structures", "authors": ["T.

An alternative approach is to eliminate optional attributes and relationships from conceptual schema diagrams by using subtypes that have only mandatory attributes and relationships.\nIn this paper, we first present a theory that led us to predict that optional attributes and relationships should be used in conceptual schema diagrams only when users of the diagrams require a surface-level understanding of the domain being represented by the diagrams.

The structural construct indicates that Internet businesses need to be stable internally and secure externally. The functional construct implies that Internet businesses should provide convenient functions in the information-gathering and order-processing phases. Finally, the representational construct indicates that they need to provide a pleasant interface both to the systemand to those using it. For each of the six metrics, we have constructed questionnaires to measure the perceived level of architectural quality and identified feature lists that may be closely related to the perceived quality level. Large-scale empirical studies were conducted both to validate the proposed metrics and to explore their relevance across four Internet business domains. The validity of the metrics has been obtained in three ways. First, the content validity of the metrics was assured by pretests and pilot survey.

The purpose of this paper is to develop theoretically justifiable constructs for measuring Web-customer satisfaction during the information phase.\nBy synthesizing the expectation-disconfirmation paradigm with empirical theories in user satisfaction, we separate Web site quality into information quality (IQ) and system quality (SQ), and propose nine key constructs for Web-customer satisfaction. The measurements for these constructs are developed and tested in a two-phase study. In the first phase, the IQ and SQ dimensions are identified, and instruments for measuring them are developed and tested. In the second phase, using the salient dimensions of Web-IQ and Web-SQ as the basis for formulating first-order factors, we develop and empirically test instruments for measuring IQ and SQ-satisfaction. Moreover, this phase involves the design and test of second-order factors for measuring Web-customer expectations, disconfirmation, and perceived performance regarding IQ and SQ. The analysis of the measurement model indicates that the proposed metrics have a relatively high degree of validity and reliability.

We focus on the optimization of bid takers' revenue, as well as on examining the welfare implications of a range of consumer-bidding strategies\u2014some observed, some hypothetical. While these progressive open discriminatory multiunit auctions with discrete bid increments are made feasible by Internet technologies, little is known about their structural characteristics, or their allocative efficiency. The multiunit and discrete nature of these mechanisms renders the traditional analytic framework of gametheory intractable (Nautz and Wolfstetter 1997). The simulation is based on theoretical revenue generating properties of these auctions. We use empirical data from real online auctions to instantiate the simulation's parameters. For example, the bidding strategies of the bidders are specified based on three broad bidding strategies observed in real online auctions. The validity of the simulation model is established and subsequently the simulation model is configured to change the values of key control factors, such as the bid increment. Our analysis indicates that the auctioneers are, most of the time, far away from the optimal choice of bid increment, resulting in substantial losses in a market with already tight margins. The simulation tool provides a test bed for jointly exploring the combinatorial space of design choices made by the auctioneer's and the bidding strategies adopted by the bidders. For instance, a multinomial logit model reveals that endogenous factors, such as the bid increment and the absolute magnitude of the auction have a statistically significant impact on consumer-bidding strategies. This endogeniety is subsequently modeled into the simulation to investigate whether the effects are significant enough to alter the optimal bid increments or auctioneer revenues. Additionally, we investigate hybrid-bidding strategies, derived as a combination of three broad strategies, such as jump bidding and strategic-at-margin (SAM) bidding. We find that hybrid strategies have the potential of significantly altering bidders' likelihood of winning, as well as their surplus."}, "14/3/article3": {"year": "2003", "volume": "14", "issue": "3", "title": "Improving Analysis Pattern Reuse in Conceptual Design: Augmenting Automated Processes with Supervised Learning", "authors": ["Sandeep PuraoSchool of Information Sciences and Technology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, State College, Pennsylvania 16802", "Veda C.

We derive an expression for calculating fault thresholds and analyze the policy to reveal the presence of three operating regions: (1) a region in which development should continue with no system integration, (2) a region in which system integration occurs if a threshold fault count has been exceeded, and (3) a region in which system integration should always take place. Analytical and numerical results demonstrate how the fault thresholds change with system complexity, team skill, development environment, and project schedule. We also show how learning that occurs during each round of system integration leads to less frequent integration in the future, and lower total construction effort. Simulation experiments reveal that the fault threshold policy can be applied even if several homogeneity assumptions in the model are relaxed, allowing for differences in the propensity among modules to accumulate faults and the effort needed to correct these faults.

Infomediaries offer matching services that facilitate establishment of a buyer-seller agreement, and value-added services that either provide a standalone benefit or enhance benefits from matching services. This paper develops and analyzes economic models of intermediaries to examine their pricing and product line design strategies. Intermediaries provide aggregation benefits: Buyers find an intermediary\u2019s service more valuable if it provides access to more sellers, and sellers value it more if it provides access to more buyers, but also when they compete with fewer sellers. Due to this unique combination of network effects, we find that an intermediary has stronger incentives to provide quality-differentiated versions of its service relative to other information goods sellers. When buyers have constant marginal valuations for service quality, the intermediary should offer only two levels of service. While it is optimal for the intermediary to offer two levels of service, increasing the quality of the low-level service reduces the intermediary\u2019s profits due to increased cannibalization of the premium service. Hence, the optimal menu consists of a basic matching service and a premium service that includes matching and value-added services.

However, there is no evidence that attracting attention increases recall of the flashed item, as is generally presumed in practice, and may even decrease the overall recall. One explanation is that when users have to use their limited attentional resources on suppressing the distraction of flash, they will have less mental resources to process information. Moreover, the results suggest that processing information about an item depends not only on the attention it attracts per se, but also on the attention that other items on the same screen attract. While flashing an item may not increase the recall of that item, it can reduce the recall of other items (especially the nontarget items) on the screen.

This raises questions about the implications of inserting self-serve technology into embedded relationships. Recent research on the role of information technology (IT) within interfirm network relations suggests that relationships and the use of IT are complementary. However, most of this research focuses on the organizational level and fails to consider the instantiation of these interfirm relations by the actions and interactions of individual actors (e.g., customers and salespeople) representing their respective firms.\nIn this paper, we explore the implications of using IT within interfirm relations through an analysis of customers\u2019 and sales representatives\u2019 (reps) work activities and interpersonal relationships. We apply a practice perspective that highlights how macrolevel phenomena such as interfirm relations are created and recreated through the microlevel actions taken by firm members. This analysis reveals that managing the complementarity between relationships and IT in practice is fraught with considerable tension. This study of WebGA, a bricks-and-clicks dotcom, highlights how the use of the self-serve technology made it more difficult for sales reps to build and maintain embedded relationships with their customers. The use of IT altered the nature and quality of information shared by the participants, undermined the ability of sales reps to provide consulting services to customers, reduced the frequency of their interaction, and prompted sales reps to expend social capital to promote customers\u2019 technology adoption.

We then develop a model of fit-as-gestalt, drawing from literatures on strategy, governance, interorganizational relationships, and outsourcing.\nNext, based on data from 311 firms in South Korea, we test universalistic and contingency perspectives in explaining the relationship between IT outsourcing strategies and outsourcing success. We then identify three congruent patterns, or gestalts, of IT outsourcing strategies. We term these strategies independent, arm's-length, and embedded strategies. To establish the predictive validity of these gestalts and the viability of a configurational perspective, we then explore the effects of these congruent gestalts vis-\u00e0-vis noncongruent patterns on three dimensions of outsourcing success: strategic competence, cost efficiency, and technology catalysis. We also contrast the effects of each of the three gestalts on each of the three dimensions of outsourcing success. Our findings indicate the superiority of the configurational approach over universalistic and contingency perspectives in explaining outsourcing success."}, "15/2/article3": {"year": "2004", "volume": "15", "issue": "2", "title": "Real Options and IT Platform Adoption: Implications for Theory and Practice", "authors": ["Robert G.

When uncertainty and irreversibility are high, concepts from real options should be used to properly structure the evaluation and management of investment opportunities, and thereby capture the value of managerial flexibility. However, while innovation researchers have posited that option value can influence the motivations of early adopters, and options researchers have identified emerging IT as a promising area for application of options valuation techniques, there has yet to be a systematic theoretical integration of work on IT innovation and real options.\nThis paper seeks to fill this gap by developing a model of the determinants of option value associated with investments in innovative IT platforms. In so doing, the model addresses a central question in the innovation field: When should a firm take a lead role in innovation with emerging technologies? The analysis begins with an explanation of real options analysis and how it differs from conventional approaches for evaluating new technologies. Then a set of 12 factors\u2014drawn from 4 complementary perspectives on organizational innovation (technology strategy, organizational learning, innovation bandwagons, and technology adaptation)\u2014is synthesized into a model of the option value of IT platform investments. Rationales are provided to explain the direct effects of these factors on option value, and selected interactions among the factors are also considered.

We demonstrate that a profit-maximizing monopolist invests in IT (modeled as changes in parametric characteristics of the firm) to design a better-quality product and charge a higher price. While this profit-maximizing adjustment generates more consumer surplus, it also increases production costs in a way that adversely affects productivity. In contrast, a simple model extension shows that when a firm is unwilling or unable to improve product quality, then IT investments result in suboptimal improvements in profits, an increase in consumer surplus, and an increase in productivity. Together, these models highlight the way in which product quality moderates the relationship between IT investments and economic performance. We also demonstrate that these relationships are robust to the socially optimal case in which a social planner chooses price and quality to maximize social welfare. In addition, we demonstrate that the results of the monopoly model hold when considering the design and development of products offered free of charge (e.g., free online content), but that provide indirect benefits to the firm (e.g., more advertising revenues)."}, "15/3/article6": {"year": "2004", "volume": "15", "issue": "3", "title": "Managing Digital Piracy: Pricing and Protection", "authors": ["Arun SundararajanLeonard N.

It is shown that a monopolist's optimal pricing schedule can be characterized as a simple combination of the zero-piracy pricing schedule and a piracy-indifferent pricing schedule that makes all customers indifferent between legal usage and piracy. An increase in the quality of pirated goods, while lowering prices and profits, increases total surplus by expanding both the fraction of legal users and the volume of legal usage. In the absence of price discrimination, a seller's optimal level of technology-based protection against piracy is shown to be at the technologically maximal level, which maximizes the difference between the quality of the legal and pirated goods. However, when a seller can price discriminate, its optimal choice is always a strictly lower level of technology-based protection. These results are based on the following digital rights conjecture: that granting digital rights increases the incidence of digital piracy, and that managing digital rights therefore involves restricting the rights of usage that contribute to customer value. Moreover, if a digital rights management system weakens over time due to the underlying technology being progressively hacked, a seller's optimal strategic response may involve either increasing or decreasing its level of technology-based protection. This direction of change is related to whether the DRM technology implementing each marginal reduction in piracy is increasingly less or more vulnerable to hacking.

These systems are designed to meet the requirements of a diverse set of stakeholders with different business needs, priorities, and objectives. One managerial tool for addressing and reconciling such differences is control, which encompasses all attempts to motivate individuals to act in a manner that is consistent with organizational objectives. This paper examines two research questions. How do stakeholders exercise control during different phases of large IS projects? Why do control choices change across project phases? Results of two case studies suggest control is exercised differently for each phase. During the initial phase of a project, control is exercised as \u201ccollective sensemaking,\u201d in which both IS and business stakeholders utilize mostly informal mechanisms of control. During development, \u201ctechnical winnowing\u201d of mechanisms occurs such that control is vested primarily in IS managers, who structure hierarchical relationships with subordinates and who rely extensively on formal control mechanisms. Both IS and business stakeholders employ formal and informal mechanisms during implementation to exercise control as \u201ccollaborative coordinating.\u201d The results also suggest that changes in control choices from one project phase to another are triggered by factors in the project, stakeholder, and global contexts. As factors change across phases, so too do control choices. Further, problems that surface in one project phase trigger changes to controls in subsequent phases. These findings are integrated into a model of the dynamics of control.

In this paper, we seek to assess the value of IDSs in a firm\u2019s IT security architecture. We find that the IDS configuration, represented by detection (true positive) and false alarm (false positive) rates, determines whether a firm realizes a positive or negative value from the IDS. Specifically, we show that a firm realizes a positive value from an IDS only when the detection rate is higher than a critical value, which is determined by the hacker\u2019s benefit and cost parameters. When the firm realizes a positive (negative) value, the IDS deters (sustains) hackers. However, irrespective of whether the firm realizes a positive or negative value from the IDS, the IDS enables the firm to better target its investigation of users, while keeping the detection rate the same. Our results suggest that the positive value of an IDS results not from improved detection per se, but from an increased deterrence enabled by improved detection. Finally, we show that the firm realizes a strictly nonnegative value if the firm configures the IDS optimally based on the hacking environment."}, "16/1/article4": {"year": "2005", "volume": "16", "issue": "1", "title": "The Value of Intrusion Detection Systems in Information Technology Security Architecture", "authors": ["Subhajyoti BandyopadhyayWarrington School of Business, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611", "John M.

The study finds that technology competence, firm size, financial commitment, competitive pressure, and regulatory support are important antecedents of e-business use. In addition, the study finds that, while both front-end and back-end capabilities contribute to e-business value, back-end integration has a much stronger impact. While front-end functionalities are becoming commodities, e-businesses are more differentiated by back-end integration. This is consistent with the resource-based theory because back-end integration possesses the value-creating characteristics of resources (e.g., firm specific, difficult to imitate), which are strengthened by the Internet-enabled connectivity.

Regardless of dimension, the quality of the input (ideas generated) determined the quality of the output (decisions made).

Determining winners in such auctions is an NP-hard problem, and significant research is being conducted in this area. However, multiple-round (iterative) combinatorial auctions present significant challenges in bid formulations as well. Because the combinatorial dynamics in iterative auctions can make a given bid part of a winning and nonwinning set of bids without any changes in the bid, bidders are usually not able to evaluate whether they should revise their bid at a given point in time or not. Therefore, in this paper we address various computational problems that are relevant from the bidder's perspective. In particular, we introduce two bid evaluation metrics that can be used by bidders to determine whether any given bid can be a part of the winning allocation and explore their theoretical properties. Based on these metrics, we also develop efficient data structures and algorithms that provide comprehensive information about the current state of the auction at any time, which can help bidders in evaluating their bids and bidding strategies.

The objective of reputation mechanisms in such pure moral hazard settings is to induce sellers to exert high effort as often as possible. I study the impact of various mechanism parameters (such as the granularity of solicited feedback, the format of the public reputation profile, the policy regarding missing feedback, and the rules for admitting new sellers) on the resulting market efficiency. I find that maximum efficiency is bounded away from the hypothetical first-best case where sellers can credibly precommit to full cooperation by a factor that is related to the probability that cooperating sellers may receive \u201cunfair\u201d bad ratings. Furthermore, maximum efficiency is independent of the length of past history summarized in a seller's public reputation profile. I apply my framework to a simplified model of eBay's feedback mechanism and conclude that, in pure moral hazard settings, eBay's simple mechanism is capable of inducing the maximum theoretical efficiency independently of the number of recent ratings that are being summarized in a seller's profile. I derive optimal policies for dealing with missing feedback and easy online identity changes. Finally, I show that if the number of buyers is large, the results obtained in the monopoly case are also approximately valid in settings where multiple sellers of different reputations simultaneously offer auctions for identical goods."}, "16/3/article1": {"year": "2005", "volume": "16", "issue": "3", "title": "Editorial Notes", "authors": ["Vallabh SambamurthyEli Broad Graduate School of Management, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824"], "keywords": ["  digital networks ", " social networks ", " special issue ", " senior editors "], "abstract": "This editorial announces a new special issue calling for research on the interplay between digital and social networks.

To curb the growth of errors, some of the effort must be taken away from construction and assigned to testing and debugging. A key finding of this model is that the practice of alternating between pure construction and pure debugging is suboptimal. Instead, it is desirable to concurrently construct and debug the system.

We find that as consumers\u2019 willingness to pay for research declines, the incumbent finds it optimal to unbundle its offering when competing with the online entrant.

Applied to buyer-seller relationships, PCV is defined as a buyer\u2019s perception of having being treated wrongly regarding the terms of an exchange agreement with an individual seller. PCV with individual sellers is proposed as a formative first-order construct driven by the occurrence of fraud, product misrepresentation, contract default, delivery delay, and failure to follow product guarantees and payment policies. PCV with an individual seller is proposed to prompt a generalized perception of PCV with the entire community of sellers in a marketplace.\nPCV with the community of sellers is hypothesized to negatively affect buyer transaction behavior in a marketplace by directly impacting transaction intentions, price premiums, trust, perceived risk, and the perceived effectiveness of institutional structures. PCV is also hypothesized to act as a moderator, transforming the buyers\u2019 initial trust-based mindset to one more centered on perceived risk. Finally, PCV is hypothesized to attenuate the positive impact of trust on transaction intentions, while reinforcing the negative impact of perceived risk on transaction intentions. It is also proposed to attenuate the impact of the perceived effectiveness of institutional structures on trust, while strengthening its negative effect on perceived risk. As a means of preventing PCV, the buyers\u2019 positive experience and the sellers\u2019 favorable past performance are hypothesized to make PCV with the community of sellers less likely.\nA combination of primary and secondary longitudinal data from 404 buyers in eBay\u2019s and Amazon\u2019s online auctions support the proposed hypotheses, validating PCV as a central element of buyer-seller relationships in online marketplaces. Interestingly, ex post facto results show that buyers with higher perceptions of PCV with the community of sellers are less likely to experience PCV with an individual seller in the future.\nImplications for buyer-seller relationships in online marketplaces and the PCV literature are discussed. Also discussed is how the increasing number of buyers who experience PCV in online marketplaces extends the literature that has been largely developed based on buyers who had not experienced PCV."}, "16/4/article5": {"year": "2005", "volume": "16", "issue": "4", "title": "Managing Piracy: Pricing and Sampling Strategies for Digital Experience Goods in Vertically Segmented Markets", "authors": ["Ramnath K.

Consumers are aware of the true fit of an experience good to their tastes only after consumption, and as piracy offers an additional (albeit illegal) consumption opportunity, traditional segmentation findings from economics and sampling recommendations from marketing, need to be revisited. We develop a two-stage model of piracy for a market where consumers are heterogeneous in their marginal valuation for quality and their moral costs. In our model, some consumers pirate the product in the first stage allowing them to update their fit-perception that may result in re-evaluation of their buying/pirating decision in the second stage. We recommend distinct pricing and sampling strategies for underestimated and overestimated products and suggest that any potential benefits of piracy can be internalized through product sampling. Two counterintuitive results stand out. First, piracy losses are more severe for products that do not live up to their hype rather than for those that have been undervalued in the market, thus requiring a greater deterrence investment for the former, and second, unlike physical goods where sampling is always beneficial for underestimated products, sampling for digital goods is optimal only under narrowly defined circumstances due to the price boundaries created by both piracy and segmentation."}, "16/4/article6": {"year": "2005", "volume": "16", "issue": "4", "title": "Research Note\u2014Two Competing Perspectives on Automatic Use: A Theoretical and Empirical Comparison", "authors": ["Sung S.

The objective of this study is to compare two contrasting views in the literature on the nature of automatic use, namely, the habit/automaticity perspective (HAP) and the instant activation perspective (IAP). According to HAP, automatic use occurs because of the force of habit/automaticity without the formation of evaluations and intention; thus, past use\u2014which is a proxy for habit/automaticity\u2014is believed to weaken the evaluations-intention-usage relationship. In contrast, IAP posits that automatic use is simply an expedited form of conscious use; accordingly, as with conscious use, automatic use is still a function of evaluations/intention, so past use will not weaken the evaluations-intention-usage relationship. We tested the competing hypotheses using 2,075 cross-sectional and 990 longitudinal responses from actual users of two online news sites. Our results show that the evaluations-intention-usage relationship is generally weaker among heavier users than among lighter users. These findings suggest that with an increase in past use, user behavior becomes less evaluative and less intentional, in support of the argument that automatic use is driven more by habit/automaticity than by instant activation of cognitions.

Our thesis was that while IS domain knowledge is important in solving all such tasks, the role of application domain knowledge is contingent upon the type of understanding task under investigation. We use the theory of cognitive fit to establish theoretical differences in the role of application domain knowledge among the different types of schema understanding tasks. We hypothesize that application domain knowledge does not influence the solution of syntactic and semantic comprehension tasks for which cognitive fit exists, but does influence the solution of schema-based problem-solving tasks for which cognitive fit does not exist.\nTo assess performance on different types of conceptual schema understanding tasks, we conducted a laboratory experiment in which participants with high- and low-IS domain knowledge responded to two equivalent conceptual schemas that represented high and low levels of application knowledge (familiar and unfamiliar application domains). As expected, we found that IS domain knowledge is important in the solution of all types of conceptual schema understanding tasks in both familiar and unfamiliar applications domains, and that the effect of application domain knowledge is contingent on task type.

In contrast, this paper emphasizes that information technology enables greater completeness of buyer-supplier contracts through more economical monitoring of additional dimensions of supplier performance. The number of terms included in the contract is an imperfect substitute for the number of suppliers. Based on this idea, alternative conditions are identified under which increased use of information technology leads to a reduction in the number of suppliers without invoking relationship-specific costs. We find that a substantial increase in contract completeness due to reduced cost of information technology could increase the cost per supplier even though the cost of coordination and the cost per term monitored decrease. Such an increase in the cost per supplier leads to a reduction in the number of suppliers with whom the buyer chooses to do business. Similarly, we find that if coordination cost is reduced when more information technology is deployed so that the number of suppliers in the buyer\u2019s pool increases substantially, the buyer might choose to make the supplier contracts less complete, instead relying on a more market-oriented approach to finding a supplier with good fit."}, "17/3/article1": {"year": "2006", "volume": "17", "issue": "3", "title": "Editorial Notes", "authors": ["Vallabh SambamurthyEli Broad Graduate School of Management, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824"], "keywords": ["  globalization of research ", " special issues "], "abstract": "Information Systems Research continues to grow with submission increases, in no small part due to greater interest in the journal from Asian academics.

In this article, we present a systematic approach for reconceptualizing the system usage construct in particular nomological contexts. Comprising two stages, definition and selection, the approach enables researchers to develop clear and valid measures of system usage for a given theoretical and substantive context. The definition stage requires that researchers define system usage and explicate its underlying assumptions. In the selection stage, we suggest that system usage be conceptualized in terms of its structure and function. The structure of system usage is tripartite, comprising a user, system, and task, and researchers need to justify which elements of usage are most relevant for their study.

The principal finding is that, in trading settings with pure moral hazard and noisy ratings, if the per-period profit margin of cooperating sellers is sufficiently high, a mechanism that does not publish every single rating it receives but rather only updates a trader's public reputation profile every k transactions with a summary statistic of a trader's most recent k ratings can induce higher average levels of cooperation and market efficiency than a mechanism that publishes all ratings as soon as they are posted.

Prior research suggests that a portfolio of different mechanisms, employed frequently, can be required for effective knowledge transfer. However, little research exists that examines under what situations differing portfolios of mechanisms are selected. Further, it is not clear how effective different portfolio designs are. In this study, we conceptualize knowledge transfer portfolios in terms of their composition (the types of mechanisms used) and their intensity (the frequency with which the mechanisms are utilized). We hypothesize the influence of organizational design decisions on the composition and intensity of knowledge transfer portfolios for SPI. We then posit how the composition and intensity of knowledge transfer portfolios affect performance improvement. Our findings indicate that a more intense portfolio of knowledge transfer mechanisms is used when the source and recipient are proximate, when they are in a hierarchical relationship, or when they work in different units. Further, a source and recipient select direction-based portfolios when they are farther apart, in a hierarchical relationship, or work in different units. In terms of performance, our results reveal that the fit between the composition and intensity of the knowledge transfer portfolio influences the recipient's performance improvement. At lower levels of intensity direction-based portfolios are more effective, while at higher levels of intensity routine-based portfolios yield the highest performance improvement.

However, predictive models are used as part of a decision-making process, and costly improvements in model accuracy do not always result in better decisions. This paper introduces a new approach for active data acquisition that specifically targets decision making. The new decision-centric approach departs from traditional active learning by placing emphasis on acquisitions that are more likely to affect decision making. We describe two different types of decision-centric techniques. Next, using direct-marketing data, we compare various data-acquisition techniques. We demonstrate that strategies for reducing statistical error can be wasteful in a decision-making context, and show that one decision-centric technique in particular can improve targeting decisions significantly. We also show that this method is robust in the face of decreasing quality of utility estimations, eventually converging to uniform random sampling, and that it can be extended to situations where different data acquisitions have different costs. The results suggest that businesses should consider modifying their strategies for acquiring information through normal business transactions. For example, a firm such as Amazon.com that models consumer preferences for customized marketing may accelerate learning by proactively offering recommendations\u2014not merely to induce immediate sales, but for improving recommendations in the future."}, "18/1/article3": {"year": "2007", "volume": "18", "issue": "1", "title": "Releasing Individually Identifiable Microdata with Privacy Protection Against Stochastic Threat: An Application to Health Information", "authors": ["Robert GarfinkelDepartment of Operations and Information Management, School of Business, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06029", "Ram GopalDepartment of Operations and Information Management, School of Business, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06029", "Steven ThompsonDepartment of Operations and Information Management, School of Business, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06029"], "keywords": ["  data security ", " privacy ", " health information ", " optimization "], "abstract": "The ability to collect and disseminate individually identifiable microdata is becoming increasingly important in a number of arenas.

The business-centric framework articulates three compelling reasons why information technology (IT) matters in business: (1) IT continually transform industry and society, (2) executive decisions about IT investments, governance, and strategy are critical to organizational success, and (3) deriving value from increasingly available data trails defines effective decision making in the digital economy. However, our conversations with the leadership of 45 business schools and our subsequent data indicate that business schools are challenged by effectively training future executives to think about these reasons and act on them as part of a forward-looking program of business education that is grounded in stable concepts.

What are the factors and mechanisms that make service occupations amenable to global disaggregation? This research addresses these questions by building on previous work by Apte and Mason (1995) and Rai et al. (2006) that focuses on the unbundling of information and physical flows. We propose a theory of service disaggregation and argue that high information intensity makes an occupation more amenable to disaggregation because the activities in such occupations can be codified, standardized, and modularized. We empirically validate our theoretical model using data on more than 300 service occupations. We find that at the mean skill level, the information intensity of an occupation is positively associated with the disaggregation potential of that occupation, and the effect of information intensity on disaggregation potential is mediated by the modularizability of an occupation. We also find that skills moderate the effect of information intensity on service disaggregation.\nFurthermore, we study the patterns in U.S. employment and salary growth from 2000 to 2004. Contrary to popular perception, we do not find any adverse effect in terms of employment growth or salary growth for high information-intensity occupations at the mean skill level. Our findings show that high-skill occupations have experienced higher employment and salary growth than low-skill occupations at the mean level of information intensity. Notably, high information-intensity occupations that require higher skill levels have experienced higher employment growth, though this employment growth is accompanied by a decline in salary growth. Occupations with a higher need for physical presence have also experienced higher employment growth and lower salary growth. Overall, these results imply that firms and managers need to consider the modularizability of occupations as they reallocate global resources to pursue cost and innovation opportunities. For individual workers, our results highlight the importance of continuous investments in human capital and skill acquisition because high information-intensity and high-skill occupations appear to be relatively less vulnerable to global disaggregation."}, "18/3/article3": {"year": "2007", "volume": "18", "issue": "3", "title": "Leveraging Standard Electronic Business Interfaces to Enable Adaptive Supply Chain Partnerships", "authors": ["Arvind MalhotraKenan-Flagler Business School, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27499", "Sanjay GosainCapital Group Companies, Inc., 135 S.

SEBIs enables partners to gain insight into their broader environments, enriching each partner's perspective (enhanced bridging). SEBIs also help strengthen the cooperative ties between partners, motivating each partner to adapt for collective gain (enhanced bonding).\nOur research model is empirically tested using data collected from 41 demand-side supply chain partnerships (between original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors, and retailers) in the information technology (IT) industry. The results show that collaborative information exchange (CIE) between supply chain partners mediates the relationship between use of SEBIs and mutual adaptation (MA) and adaptive knowledge creation between supply chain partners. Interestingly, the use of SEBIs is found to be directly associated with MA but only indirectly associated with adaptive knowledge creation.\nThe study points out that the strategic impacts of SEBIs go well beyond the exchange of transaction information and process integration.

The study tests this proposition in a sample of business process sourcing choices made by 93 medium and large U.S. firms. The results show that firms tend to choose domestic outsourcing for processes that are high in modularity and offshore outsourcing for processes that are low in modularity. Further, when processes can be detached from a firm's IT infrastructure, firms tend to use offshore outsourcing. However, when processes are tightly coupled with underlying IT infrastructure, it may be infeasible to detach processes and execute them in remote locations.

This reshapes the extended enterprise from the traditional network of upstream manufacturers and downstream retailers to include midstream third-party and manufacturer-owned referral services in the supply chain. We model competition between retailers in a supply chain with such digitally enabled institutions and consider their impact on the optimal contracts among the manufacturer, referral intermediary, and the retailers. Offline, retailers face a higher customer discovery cost. In return, they can engage in price discrimination based on consumer valuations. Online, they save on the discovery costs but lose the ability to identify consumer valuations. This critical trade-off drives firms' equilibrium strategies. We derive the optimal contracts for different entities in the supply chain and highlight how these contracts change with the entry of independent and manufacturer-owned referral services. The establishment of a referral service is a strategic decision by the manufacturer. It leads to diversion of supply chain profit from a third-party infomediary to the manufacturer. Further, it enables the manufacturer to respond to an infomediary, by giving itself greater flexibility in setting the unit wholesale fee to the profit-maximizing level. Both third-party and manufacturer-sponsored referral services play a critical role in enabling retailers to discriminate across consumers' different valuations. Retailers use online referral services to screen out low-valuation consumers and sell only to high-valuation consumers in the online channel. Our model thus endogenously derives a correlation between consumer valuation and online purchase behavior.

To achieve these objectives we develop a two-stage model of search intermediaries in a vertically differentiated product market. In the first stage an intermediary chooses a search engine design that specifies to which extent a firm's search rank is determined by its bid and to which extent it is determined by the product offering's performance. In the second stage, based on the search engine design, competing firms place their open bids to be paid for each referral by the search engine. We find that the revenue-maximizing search engine design bases rankings on a weighted average of product performance and bid amount. Nonzero pure-strategy equilibria of the underlying discontinuous bidding game generally exist but are not robust with respect to noisy clicks in the system. We determine a unique nondegenerate mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium that is robust to noisy clicks. In this equilibrium firms of low product performance fully dissipate their rents, which are appropriated by the search intermediary and the firm with the better product. The firms' expected bid amounts are generally nonmonotonic in product performance and depend on the search engine design parameter. The intermediary's profit-maximizing design choice, by attributing a positive weight to the firms' bids, tends to obfuscate search results and reduce overall consumer surplus compared to the socially optimal design of fully transparent results ranked purely on product performance."}, "18/4/article5": {"year": "2007", "volume": "18", "issue": "4", "title": "The Performance Effects of Complementarities Between Information Systems, Marketing, Manufacturing, and Supply Chain Processes", "authors": ["Sundar BharadwajGoizueta Business School, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322", "Anandhi BharadwajGoizueta Business School, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322", "Elliot BendolyGoizueta Business School, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322"], "keywords": ["  manufacturing performance ", " coordination ", " integrated information systems ", " marketing and supply chain "], "abstract": "Manufacturing firms are increasingly using advanced enterprise-level information systems to coordinate and synchronize externally oriented functions such as marketing and supply chain and internally oriented activities such as manufacturing.

Consistent with the complementarity perspective, we view this specific form of IS capability as enhancing manufacturing's coordination with marketing and supply chain functions to drive manufacturing performance. Additionally, the theoretical model presented here introduces manufacturing-IS coordination, a form of coordination not considered in past research, as a key antecedent to integrated IS capability.

We find that when the software security risk is high and the piracy enforcement level is low, or when tendency for piracy in the consumer population is high, it is optimal for the vendor to restrict unlicensed users from applying security patches. When piracy tendency in the consumer population is low, applying software security patch restrictions is optimal for the vendor only when the piracy enforcement level is high. If patching costs are sufficiently low, however, an unrestricted patch release policy maximizes vendor profits. We also show that the vendor can use security patch restrictions as a substitute to investment in software security, and this effect can significantly reduce welfare. Furthermore, in certain cases, increased piracy enforcement levels can actually hurt vendor profits. We also show that governments can increase social surplus and intellectual property protection simultaneously by increasing piracy enforcement and utilizing the strategic interaction of piracy patch restrictions and network security.

Finally, we develop a market maker mechanism for optimal multilateral allocation and surplus sharing in a network. The proposed CPN is closely tied to two fundamental properties of Internet service technology: positive network externality among cooperating SPs and the property of effective multiplication of capacity allocation among several distributed service sites. We show that there exist significant incentives for SPs to engage in cooperative allocation and surplus sharing. We further demonstrate that intermediation can enhance the allocation effectiveness and that the opportunity to allocation and surplus sharing can play an important role in infrastructure planning.

In doing so, we investigate the role of the extensively researched concept of service quality in relation to SSF. Although service quality provides guidance for how supporting services should be provided (e.g., responsively and reliably), it does not address what those services are (e.g., product recommendations). SSF addresses this deficiency, thus providing both theoretical and practical benefits through a focus on IT design and deployment. The results of a field study support that SSF is an important predictor of customer beliefs and behavior, beyond that predicted by service quality alone.

Relying heavily on the theory and methods behind social network analysis, we introduce the concept of multimodal networks to assess both users and information systems as equivalent nodes in a single social network. This perspective allows us to examine the influence of information systems on organizational outcomes as a function of all of the user-system and interpersonal interactions in a group. We explore two different possible mechanisms for this influence: (1) direct user-system interactions by aggregating the strength of all the dyadic user-system interactions in a group, and (2) indirect user-system interactions by assessing the centrality of the information systems within the social network. We survey approximately 600 individuals in 40 healthcare groups to test whether either or both of these mechanisms are associated with two types of organizational performance outcomes\u2014efficiency and quality of care. We find that the centrality of the information systems within the network is significantly and positively associated with both efficiency and quality outcomes, but that the average strength of the user-system interactions is not.

Structural and cognitive capital were more important to knowledge integration when teams communicated through lean digital networks than when they communicated face-to-face; relational capital directly impacted knowledge integration equally, regardless of the communication media used by the team.

To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a method for event-based dynamic network visualization and analysis together with its exploratory social network intelligence software Commetrix. Based on longitudinal data of corporate email communication, the paper demonstrates how exploration of animated graphs combined with measuring temporal network changes identifies measurement artifacts of static network analysis, describes community formation processes and network lifecycles, bridges actor level with network level analysis by analyzing the structural impact of actor activities, and measures how network structures react to external events.

In Internet auctions, an important design option for sellers is the setting of a secret reserve price that has to be met by a buyer's bid for a successful purchase. Bidders have strong incentives to learn more about the secret reserve price in these auctions, thereby relying on their own network of friends or digital networks of users with similar interests and information needs. Information-sharing and flow in digital networks, both person-to-person and via communities, can change bidding behavior and thus can have important implications for buyers and sellers in secret reserve price auctions. This paper uses a multiparadigm approach to analyze the impact of information diffusion in social networks on bidding behavior in secret reserve price auctions. We first develop an analytical model for the effect of shared information on individual bidding behavior in a secret reserve price auction with a single buyer facing a single seller similar to eBay's Best Offer and some variants of NYOP. Next, we combine the implications from our analytical model with relational data that describe the individual's position in social networks. We empirically test the implications of our analytical model in a laboratory experiment, and examine the impact of information diffusion in social networks on bidding behavior in a field study with real purchases where we use a virtual world as proxy for the real world. We find that the amount and dispersion of information in the individualized context, and betweenness centrality in the social network context, have a significant impact on bidding behavior.

The estimation procedure relies mainly on knowing the highest bid, which is not disclosed by eBay but is available to us from our experiment. At the outset we assume a private value second-price sealed-bid auction setting, as well as a lack of alternative buying options within or outside eBay. Our analysis, based on a sample of 4,514 eBay auctions, indicates that consumers extract a median surplus of at least $4 per eBay auction. This estimate is unbiased under the above assumptions; otherwise it is a lower bound. The surplus distribution is highly skewed given the diverse nature of the data.

As such dispersion increases, virtual teams tend to experience greater and more diverse conflict compared to co-located teams. Since the dynamics of virtual team leadership are not yet well understood, research that examines how team leaders alleviate threats to team cohesion and provide strategies for conflict resolution makes significant contributions to the literature. Our study uses a survey-based methodology to examine the perceptions of 159 virtual team members employed by a large U.S. telecommunications corporation and five Korean firms involved in construction, finance, business consulting, sales, and distribution. The study integrates the dynamic model of conflict in distributed teams with the behavioral complexity in leadership theory to investigate the roles that virtual team leaders must effectively employ to reduce various forms of virtual team conflict. Our findings indicate that communication technologies are effective in reducing task conflict; however, the team leader may also mitigate task conflict by assuming the role of monitor. Likewise, process conflict may be abated in the virtual team as the leader performs coordinator activities.

We demonstrate that OSSNs overcome exchange problems by primarily relying on social, rather than legal, mechanisms; similar to the OSS communities from which they emerged. This is made possible because OSSNs use IT infrastructures that provide high visibility for primary value-creating activities. The research utilizes a multimethod theory-building approach, deriving a model from extant research, refining the model through qualitative case study analysis, and further refining the model through quantitative analysis of survey data. The paper reveals the manifestation of social mechanisms in OSSNs and how these are used for coordinating and safeguarding exchanges between firms. Specifically, we illustrate the primary importance of a shared macroculture (goals and norms) and collective sanctions for punishing firms who violate these goals/norms.

However, over a short time period (two days in this study), this initial fit no longer predicted performance; performance of teams using better fitting technology remained constant while teams using poor-fitting technology innovated and adapted, improving performance. There are two key findings from this study. First, fit can predict team performance soon after technology adoption, but initial assessments of fit are temporary as teams innovate and adapt; thus, our current theoretical models of fitting technology to a task likely will not be useful beyond the first use. Second, teams should understand how to better adapt existing technology and work structures.

Using data of 743 manufacturing firms, our analysis indicates significant contribution of IT to supply chains, which is generated through development of the digitally enabled integration capability and manifested at the process level along the supply chain. The technological resource alone, however, does not hold the answer to IT value creation. In fact, managerial skills, which enable adaptations on supply chain processes and corporate strategy to accommodate the use of IT, are shown to play the strongest role in IT value creation.

In this paper we study configuration of and interaction between a firewall and intrusion detection systems (IDS). We show that deploying a technology, whether it is the firewall or the IDS, could hurt the firm if the configuration is not optimized for the firm's environment. A more serious consequence of deploying the two technologies with suboptimal configurations is that even if the firm could benefit when each is deployed alone, the firm could be hurt by deploying both. Configuring the IDS and the firewall optimally eliminates the conflict between them, ensuring that if the firm benefits from deploying each of these technologies when deployed alone, it will always benefit from deploying both. When optimally configured, we find that these technologies complement or substitute each other. Furthermore, we find that while the optimal configuration of an IDS does not change whether it is deployed alone or together with a firewall, the optimal configuration of a firewall has a lower detection rate (i.e., allowing more access) when it is deployed with an IDS than when deployed alone. Our results highlight the complex interactions between firewall and IDS technologies when they are used together in a security architecture, and, hence, the need for proper configuration to benefit from these technologies."}, "20/2/article4": {"year": "2009", "volume": "20", "issue": "2", "title": "Willingness to Pay in an Open Source Software Environment", "authors": ["T.

For pairs of members with spatial boundaries and no temporal boundaries (those in different cities with overlapping work hours), synchronous communication technologies such as the telephone, instant messaging (IM), and Web conferencing provide a means for real-time interaction. However, for pairs of members with spatial and temporal boundaries (those in different cities with nonoverlapping work hours), asynchronous communication technologies, such as e-mail, provide a way to interact intermittently. Using survey data from 675 project members (representing 5,674 pairs of members) across 108 projects in a multinational semiconductor firm, we develop and empirically test a relational model of coordination delay. In our model, the likelihood of delay for pairs of members is a function of the spatial and temporal boundaries that separate them, as well as the communication technologies they use to coordinate their work. As expected, greater use of synchronous web conferencing reduces coordination delay for pairs of members in different cities with overlapping work hours relative to pairs of members with nonoverlapping work hours. Unexpectedly, greater use of asynchronous e-mail does not reduce coordination delay for pairs of members in different cities with nonoverlapping work hours, but rather reduces coordination delay for those with overlapping work hours.

The study reveals that agility should be viewed as a multifaceted concept having three dimensions: resource, process, and linkage. Resource agility is based on the distributed development team's access to necessary human and technological resources. Process agility pertains to the agility that originates in the team's systems development method guiding the project, its environmental scanning, and sense-making routines to anticipate possible crises, and its work practices enabling collaboration across time zones. Linkage agility arises from the nature of interactional relationships within the distributed team and with relevant project stakeholders, and is composed of cultural and communicative elements.

Key to such programs will be the development of a robust contingency framework for deciding when (in what conditions) plan-based and agile methods should be used. We develop a basic contingency framework in this paper, one that models the benefit/cost economics described in narratives about the transition from craft to industrial production of physical products. We use this framework to demonstrate the power of even a simple model to help us accomplish three objectives: (1) to refocus discussions about the appropriate design of software development processes, concentrating on when to use particular approaches and how they might be usefully combined; (2) to suggest and guide a trajectory of research that can support and enrich this discussion; and (3) to suggest a technology-based explanation for the emergence of agile development at this point in history.

Furthermore, as demand uncertainty increases, less vertically integrated firms invest more in IT, while as industry concentration increases, more vertically integrated firms invest more in IT. The analysis also suggests that firms' choice of the level of VI and IT investment, under different levels of demand uncertainty and industry concentration, are rational. When demand uncertainty is high or industry concentration is low, increase in VI may increase coordination and production costs. Thus, less VI is rational. However, when industry concentration is high or demand uncertainty is low, increase in VI may decrease coordination and production costs. Thus, firms choose more VI in such industries.

An important attribute of a market session chosen by the procurer is its information revelation policy. The revelation policy determines the information (such as the number of competitors, the winning bids, etc.) that will be revealed to participating suppliers at the conclusion of each market session. Suppliers participating in multiple market sessions use strategic bidding and fake their own cost structure to obtain information revealed at the end of each market session. The information helps to reduce two types of uncertainties encountered in future market sessions, namely, their opponents' cost structure and an estimate of the number of their competitors. Whereas the first type of uncertainty is present in physical and e-marketplaces, the second type of uncertainty naturally arises in IT-enabled marketplaces. Through their effect on the uncertainty faced by suppliers, information revelation policies influence the bidding behavior of suppliers which, in turn, determines the expected price paid by the procurer. Therefore, the choice of information revelation policy has important consequences for the procurer.\nThis paper develops a partially observable Markov decision process model of supplier bidding behavior and uses a multiagent e-marketplace simulation to analyze the effect that two commonly used information revelation policies\u2014complete information policy and incomplete information policy\u2014have on the expected price paid by the procurer. We find that the expected price under the complete information policy is lower than that under the incomplete information policy.

However, the reuse of information systems artifacts has been shown to be susceptible to the phenomenon of anchoring and adjustment. Anchoring often leads to a systematic adjustment bias in which people fail to make sufficient changes to an anchor in response to the needs of a new task. In a study involving 157 novice query writers from six universities, we examined the effect of this phenomenon on the reuse of Structured Query Language (SQL) queries under varying levels of domain familiarity and for different types of anchors. Participants developed SQL queries to respond to four information requests in a familiar domain and four information requests in an unfamiliar domain. For two information requests in each domain, participants were also provided with sample queries (anchors) that answered similar information requests. We found evidence that the opportunity to reuse sample queries resulted in an adjustment bias leading to poorer quality query results and greater overconfidence in the correctness of results. The results also indicate that the strength of the adjustment bias depends on a combination of domain familiarity and type of anchor. This study demonstrates that anchoring and adjustment during query reuse can lead to queries that are less accurate than those written from scratch. We also extend the concept of anchoring and adjustment by distinguishing between surface-structure and deep-structure anchors and by considering the impact of domain familiarity on the adjustment bias."}, "21/1/article5": {"year": "2010", "volume": "21", "issue": "1", "title": "Use of Pricing Schemes for Differentiating Information Goods", "authors": ["Vidyanand ChoudharyThe Paul Merage School of Business, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California 92697"], "keywords": ["  duopoly ", " price competition ", " pricing ", " pricing schemes ", " information goods ", " differentiation "], "abstract": "Information goods vendors offer different pricing schemes such as per user pricing and site licensing.

Such strategic use of pricing schemes can allow undifferentiated sellers to earn substantial profits in a friction-free market for a commoditized information good.

A typical software development contract must deal with a variety of interrelated issues such as the quality of the developed system, the timeliness of delivery, the effort and cost associated with the project, the contract payment, and the postdelivery software support. This paper presents a contract-theoretic model that incorporates these factors to analyze how software outsourcing contracts can be designed. We find that despite their relative inefficiency, fixed-price contracts are often appropriate for simple software projects that require short development time. Time-and-materials contracts work well for more complex projects when the auditing process is efficient and effective. We also examine a type of performance-based contract called quality-level agreement and find that the first-best solution can be reached with such a contract.

This paper examines the design of keyword auctions, a novel mechanism that keyword advertising providers such as Google and Yahoo! use to allocate advertising slots. In our keyword auction model, advertisers bid their willingness-to-pay per click on their advertisements, and the advertising provider can weight advertisers' bids differently and require different minimum bids based on advertisers' click-generating potential. We study the impact and design of such weighting schemes and minimum-bid policies. We find that weighting scheme determines how advertisers with different click-generating potential match in equilibrium. Minimum bids exclude low-valuation advertisers and at the same time may distort the equilibrium matching. The efficient design of keyword auctions requires weighting advertisers' bids by their expected click-through-rates, and requires the same minimum weighted bids. The revenue-maximizing weighting scheme may or may not favor advertisers with low click-generating potential. The revenue-maximizing minimum-bid policy differs from those prescribed in the standard auction design literature. Keyword auctions that employ the revenue-maximizing weighting scheme and differentiated minimum bid policy can generate higher revenue than standard fixed-payment auctions.

In the context of complex business-to-business (B2B) search, we study how decreasing search costs affect a firm's decision to insource or outsource the procurement function, depending on whether the search process is information intensive or communication intensive. Variation in search costs changes the transaction costs of interaction between firms, as well as the contracting costs associated with outsourcing, owing to changes in the costs of moral hazard for delegated search. We study these effects in a new model that integrates search theory into the principal-agent framework, and establish that the optimal outsourcing contract has a simple \u201call or nothing\u201d performance-based structure under fairly general assumptions. Our model predicts that when B2B search is information intensive, IOS will facilitate an increase in outsourcing, market-based transactions, and a reduction in the vertical scope of extended enterprises. In contrast, when B2B search is primarily communication intensive, IOS will lead to tighter integration and an increase in the vertical scope of the extended enterprise. Our research suggests that the nature of the information technologies and of the business activities supported by IOS are crucial determinants of the organizational and industry changes they induce, and our results have important implications for a variety of industries in which both technological and agency issues will influence the eventual success of global IT-facilitated extended enterprise initiatives."}, "21/1/article10": {"year": "2010", "volume": "21", "issue": "1", "title": "Induction over Strategic Agents", "authors": ["Fidan BoyluDepartment of Operations and Information Management, School of Business, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06269", "Haldun AytugInformation Systems and Operations Management Department, The Warrington College of Business Administration, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611", "Gary J.

To infer causality from observational data that are common in empirical IS research, this study develops a new data analysis method that integrates the Bayesian networks (BN) and structural equation modeling (SEM) literatures.\nSimilar to SEM techniques (e.g., LISREL and PLS), the proposed Bayesian networks for latent variables (BN-LV) method tests both the measurement model and the structural model. The method operates in two stages: First, it inductively identifies the most likely LVs from measurement items without prespecifying a measurement model.

A key competitive dynamics question for many organizations is how to build a competitive advantage in turbulence with digital IT systems. The literature has focused mostly on developing and exercising dynamic capabilities for planned reconfiguration of existing operational capabilities in fairly stable environments with patterned \u201cwaves,\u201d but this may not always be possible, or even appropriate, in highly turbulent environments with unexpected \u201cstorms.\u201d We introduce improvisational capabilities as an alternative means for managing highly turbulent environments; we define this as the ability to spontaneously reconfigure existing resources to build new operational capabilities to address urgent, unpredictable, and novel environmental situations.

ESS firms offer software components (e.g., ERP, CRM, Marketing analytics) to shape their clients' digitization strategies. With rapid rates of technological and market innovation, the ESS industry consists of several horizontal markets that form around these components. As numerous vendors compete with each other within and across these markets, many of these horizontal markets appear to be crowded with rivals. In fact, multimarket contact and presence in crowded markets appear to be the pathways through which a majority of the ESS firms compete. Though the strategy literature has demonstrated the virtues of multimarket contact, paradoxically, the same literature argues that operating in crowded markets is not wise. In particular, crowded markets increase a firm's exposure to the whirlwinds of intense competition and have deleterious consequences for financial performance. Thus, the behavior of ESS firms raises an interesting anomaly and research question: Why do ESS firms continue to compete in crowded markets if they are deemed to be bad for financial performance? We argue that the effects of rivalry in crowded markets are counteracted by a different force, in the form of the economics of demand externalities. Demand externalities occur because the customers of ESS firms expect that software components from one market will be easily integrated with those that they buy from other markets. However, with rapid rates of technological innovation and market formation and dissolution, customers experience significant ambiguity in deciding which markets and components suit their needs. Therefore, they look at crowded markets as an important signal about the legitimacy and viability of specific components for their needs. Through their presence in crowded markets, ESS firms can signal their commitment to many of the components that customers might need for their digital platforms. Customers might find that such firms are attractive because their commitments to crowded markets can mitigate concerns about compatibilities between the components purchased across several markets. This unique potential for demand externality across markets suggests that ESS vendors might, in fact, benefit from competing in many crowded markets. We test our explanations through data across three time periods from a set of ESS firms that account for more than 95% of the revenue in this market. We find that ESS firms do reap performance benefits by competing in crowded markets. More importantly, we find that they can enhance their benefits from crowded markets if they face the same competitors in multiple markets, thereby increasing their multimarket contact with rivals. These results have interesting implications not just for understanding competitive conduct in the ESS industry but also in many of the emerging digital goods industries where the markets have similar competitive characteristics to the ESS industry.

We provide a novel perspective by considering how software firms' capabilities and their competitive actions affect their ultimate survival. Drawing on the resource-based view (RBV), we conceptualize capabilities as a firm's ability to efficiently transform input resources into outputs, relative to its peers. We define three critical capabilities of software-producing firms\u2014research and development (RD), marketing (MK), and operations (OP)\u2014and hypothesize that in the dynamic, high-technology software industry, RD and MK capabilities are most important for firm survival. We then draw on the competitive dynamics literature to theorize that competitive actions distinguished by a greater emphasis on innovation-related moves will increase firm survival more than actions emphasizing resource-related moves. Finally, we postulate that firms' capabilities will complement their competitive actions in affecting firm survival. Our empirical evaluation examines a cross-sectional, time series panel of 5,827 observations on 870 software companies from 1995 to 2007. We use a stochastic frontier production function to measure the capability for each software firm in each time period. We then use the Cox proportional hazard regression technique to relate capabilities and competitive actions to software firms' failure rates. Unexpectedly, our results reveal that higher OP capability increases software firm survival more than higher MK and RD capabilities. Further, firms with a greater emphasis on innovation-related than resource-related competitive actions have a greater likelihood of survival, and this likelihood increases even further when these firms have higher MK and OP capabilities. Additional analyses of subsectors within the software industry reveal that firms producing visual applications (e.g., graphical and video game software) have the highest MK capability but the lowest OP and RD capabilities and make twice as many innovation-related as resource-related moves. These firms have the highest market values but the worst Altman Z scores, suggesting that they are valued highly but also are at high risk for failure, and indeed the firms in this sector fail at a greater rate than expected. In contrast, firms producing traditional decision-support applications and infrastructure software have different capabilities and make different competitive moves.

While major strides have been achieved in the last decade in the information systems (IS) and strategic management literature in improving our understanding of outsourcing, the focus has been on a dyadic relationship between a client and a vendor. We demonstrate that a straightforward extrapolation of such a dyadic relationship falls short of addressing the nuanced incentive-effort-output linkages that arise when multiple vendors, who are competitors, have to cooperate and coordinate to achieve the client's business objectives. We suggest that when multiple vendors have to work together to deliver end-to-end services to a client, the choice of formal incentives and relational governance mechanisms depends on the degree of interdependence between the various tasks as well as the observability and verifiability of output. With respect to cooperation, we find that a vendor must not only put effort in a \u201cprimary\u201d task it is responsible for but also cooperate through \u201chelping\u201d effort in enabling other vendors perform their primary tasks.

We revise the strategic alignment quest to propose a co-evolution quest that addresses not only competitive strategy questions of a firm but also corporate strategy questions. The co-evolution quest seeks to increase a firm's agility and dynamism in repositioning itself, identifying profitable product-market positions as the evolving competitive landscape erodes the profitability of the firm's existing positions. To support the co-evolution quest, we revise the integration quest and propose a reconfiguration quest that encompasses not only business processes but also products and services, as well as the contracts, resources, and transactions associated with them. As the firm makes repositioning moves to co-evolve with the competitive landscape, the reconfiguration quest seeks to increase the firm's agility in disintegrating its existing nexus of contracts, resources, and transactions that support the old positions and in reconfiguring new ones that support the new positions. Finally, we revise the sustained competitive advantage quest to propose a renewal quest that recognizes the temporary nature of competitive advantage in CABS. The renewal quest seeks to destabilize the firm's old sources of competitive advantage when competitive dynamics erode their utility, rapidly create new sources of competitive advantage, and concatenate a series of temporary advantages over time.

Accordingly, we need to change the way we examine how information technology (IT) can help organizations build a strategic advantage in turbulent environments. We propose a more systemic and holistic perspective to theory building and testing in the information system (IS) strategy area and correspondingly appropriate methods that capture the complexity of this phenomenon. We term this phenomenon digital ecodynamics, defined as the holistic confluence among environmental turbulence, dynamic capabilities, and IT systems\u2014and their fused dynamic interactions unfolding as an ecosystem. We believe that a more holistic understanding of digital ecodynamics will fuel the next leap in knowledge in the IS strategy area.\nFirst, extending the strategic management literature that has mainly focused on two-way interactions between environmental turbulence and dynamic capabilities, we foreground IT systems as a third central element. We use a \u201cthreesome tango\u201d analogy1 with strong mutual interdependence to accentuate our view of digital ecodynamics\u2014while also stressing the emerging role of IT systems in triggering environmental turbulence and shaping dynamic capabilities to build a strategic advantage. Second, we propose a different paradigmatic lens (configuration theories) as an appropriate inquiring system to better understand the complexity of digital ecodynamics. The paper articulates the key aspects of configuration theories as inquiring systems, compares them with the more common variance theories and process theories, and illustrates the power of recent advances in configurational methods. Third, we create a preliminary roadmap for IS researchers to better examine digital ecodynamics using novel structural properties afforded by configuration theories (i.e., mutual causality, discontinuity, punctuated equilibria, nonlinear change). Fourth, we reflect on the broader opportunities that the configurational perspective of digital ecodynamics can create for IS strategy research.

Even if it forms the core of an organization's information systems (IS) infrastructure, there is little prior IS research on the competitive dynamics in this industry. Whereas economic modeling has generally provided the methodological framework for studying standards-driven industries, our research employs social network methods to empirically examine ESS firm competition. Although component compatibility is critical to organizational end users, there is an absence of industry-wide ESS standards and compatibility is ensured through interfirm alliances. First, our research observes that this alliance network does not conform to the equilibrium structures predicted by economics of network evolution supporting the view that it is difficult to identify dominant standards and leaders in this industry. This state of flux combined with the multifirm multicomponent nature of the industry limits the direct applicability of extant analytical models. Instead, we propose that the relative structural position acquired by a firm in its alliance network is a reasonable proxy for its standards dominance and is an indicator of its performance. In lieu of structural measures developed mainly for interpersonal networks, we develop a measure of relative firm prominence specifically for the business software network where benefits of alliances may accrue through indirect connections even if attenuated. Panel data analyses of ESS firms that account for over 95% of the industry revenues, show that our measure provides a superior model fit to extant social network measures. Two interesting counterintuitive findings emerge from our research. First, unlike other software industries compatibility considerations can trump rivalry concerns. We employ quadratic assignment procedure to show that firms freely form alliances even with their rivals.

Results from a laboratory experiment indicate that compared to separate navigation, shared navigation effectively reduces uncoupling (i.e., the loss of coordination with one's shopping partner) incidents per product discussed and leads to fewer communication exchanges dedicated to resolving each uncoupling incident, thereby enhancing coordination performance. Compared to text chat, voice chat does not help reduce the occurrence of uncoupling, but likely increases the efficiency in resolving uncoupling.

The analysis suggests that an increase in codification may damage existing network-sharing ties.

We find that despite the aforementioned tension between the codification and the network approach, a firm may still benefit from combining the two approaches. Specifically, when the future sharing potential between knowledge workers is high, a combination of the two approaches may outperform a codification-only or a network-only approach because the codification reward causes fewer network ties to break down, and the benefit from increased codification can offset the loss of some network ties. However, when the future sharing potential is low, an increase in codification reward can quickly break down the whole network.

We develop a game-theoretic model to address two critical issues of NN: (1) Who are gainers and losers of abandoning NN? (2) Will broadband service providers have greater incentive to expand their capacity without NN? We find that if the principle of NN is abolished, the broadband service provider stands to gain from the arrangement, as a result of extracting the preferential access fees from content providers. Content providers are thus left worse off, mirroring the stances of the two sides in the debate. Depending on parameter values in our framework, consumer surplus either does not change or is higher in the short run. When compared to the baseline case under NN, social welfare in the short run increases if one content provider pays for preferential treatment but remains unchanged if both content providers pay. Finally, we find that the incentive to expand infrastructure capacity for the broadband service provider and its optimal capacity choice under NN are higher than those under the no-net-neutrality (NNN) regime, except in some specific cases.

In contrast, our research explores the key role played by vendors' price-format adoption in explaining price dispersion. We empirically analyze over a half-million online and offline prices offered by major U.S. airlines in the top 500 domestic markets. Our study shows that a vendor's price format remains an important source of price dispersion in both channels even after accounting for other factors known to impact dispersion in airline ticket prices. Importantly, this finding is true for both transacted and posted tickets. We document several other interesting empirical findings. First, the lower variance in the prices of \u201ceveryday low price\u201d (EDLP) firms serves to reduce the market-level dispersion in prices when such firms are present. Moreover, the price variance of non-EDLP firms in these markets is also lower than in those markets in which EDLP competitors are absent. Second, we also find that dispersion in offered prices increases closer to the departure date, which is consistent with theoretical assertion that price dispersion increases with reservation prices. Finally, we continue to observe dispersion of online prices even after accounting for vendor strategy and other known sources of dispersion, suggesting that the prices are unlikely to converge even in the presence of sophisticated online search mechanisms."}, "22/1/article6": {"year": "2011", "volume": "22", "issue": "1", "title": "Price Formats as a Source of Price Dispersion: A Study of Online and Offline Prices in the Domestic U.S. Airline Markets", "authors": ["Ramnath K.

This study examines the impact of conversion technologies on market equilibrium in the context of sequential duopoly competition and proprietary technology standards.\nWe analyze this question by departing from the extant literature to endogenize the decision to provide a converter and incorporate explicit negotiations between firms concerning the extent of conversion. We argue that these choices better reflect the environment facing firms in digital goods industries and find that these decisions change some of the established results in the literature.\nSpecifically, we find that unless network effects are very large, the subgame-perfect equilibrium (SPNE) involves firms' agreeing to provide digital converters at a sufficiently low price to all consumers. At this equilibrium, both the entrant and the incumbent are better off because the provision of converters alleviates price competition in the market and leads to both higher product revenues and higher proceeds from the sale of converters. Moreover, under some circumstances, the provision of converters is welfare enhancing.\nThese findings have important implications for research and practice in the adoption of new digital goods as the introduction of conversion technologies can reduce the social costs of standardization without compromising the benefits of network effects."}, "22/1/article12": {"year": "2011", "volume": "22", "issue": "1", "title": "Compatibility and Proprietary Standards: The Impact of Conversion Technologies in IT Markets with Network Effects", "authors": ["Charles Zhechao LiuUniversity of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas 78249", "Esther Gal-OrJoseph M.

On the other hand, new paradigms such as overlay networks are defining service-based logical architecture for the network services that make locating content and routing more efficient. Along with Internet2's proposed service-based routing, overlay networks will create a new set of challenges in the provision and management of content over the network. However, a lack of proper infrastructure investment incentive may lead to an environment where network growth may not keep pace with the service requirements. In this paper, we present an analysis of investment incentives for network infrastructure owners under two different pricing strategies: congestion-based negative externality pricing and the prevalent flat-rate pricing. We develop a theoretically motivated gradient-based heuristic to compute maximum capacity that a network provider will be willing to invest in under different pricing schemes. The heuristic appropriates different capacities to different network components based on demand for these components. We then use a simulation model to compare the impact of dynamic congestion-based pricing with flat-rate pricing on the choice of capacity level by the infrastructure provider. The simulation model implements the heuristic and ensures that near-optimal level of capacity is allocated to each network component by checking theoretical optimality conditions. We investigate the impact of a variety of factors, including the per unit cost of capacity of a network resource, average value of the users' requests, average level of users' tolerance for delay, and the level of exogenous demand for services on the network. Our results indicate that relationships between these factors are crucial in determining which of the two pricing schemes results in a higher level of socially optimal network capacity. The simulation results provide a possible explanation for the evolution of the Internet pricing from time-based to flat-rate pricing. The results also indicate that regardless of how these factors are related, the average stream of the net benefits realized under congestion-based pricing tends to be higher than the average net benefits realized under flat-rate pricing. These central results point to the fallacy of the arguments presented by the supporters of net neutrality that do not consider the incentives for private investment in network capacity."}, "22/2/article2": {"year": "2011", "volume": "22", "issue": "2", "title": "An Analysis of Incentives for Network Infrastructure Investment Under Different Pricing Strategies", "authors": ["Alok GuptaDepartment of IDSC, Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455", "Boris JukicOperations and Information Systems, Clarkson University, Potsdam, New York 13699", "Dale O.

To understand the critical resources that contribute to digital inequality and inform public policy for stimulating initial and continued ICT usage by the SED, we drew on capital theories and conducted a field study to investigate: (1) the forms of capital for using ICT and how they differ across potential adopters who are SED and socioeconomically advantaged (SEA); (2) how these forms of capitals are relatively impacted for the SEA and the SED through public policy for ICT access; and (3) how each form of capital influences the SED's intentions to use initially and to continue to use ICT. The context for our study involved a city in the southeastern United States that offered its citizens free ICT access for Internet connectivity. Our results show that SED potential adopters exhibited lower cultural capital but higher social capital relative to the SEA. Moreover, the SED who participated in the city's initiative realized greater positive gains in cultural capital, social capital, and habitus than the SEA. In addition, we find that the SED's initial intention to use ICT was influenced by intrinsic motivation for habitus, self-efficacy for cultural capital, and important referents' expectations and support from acquaintances for social capital. Cultural capital and social cultural capital also complemented each other in driving the SED's initial use intention. The SED's continued use intention was affected by both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for habitus and both knowledge and self-efficacy for cultural capital but was not affected by social capital.

Internet-based electronic markets have the potential to reduce transaction and search costs, thereby creating more efficient, \u201cfrictionless\u201d markets, as predicted by theories in information economics. However, earlier work has reported significant levels of price dispersion on the Internet, which is in contrast to theoretical predictions. A key feature of the existing stream of work has been its use of posted prices to estimate price dispersion. In theory, this can lead to an overestimation of price dispersion because a sale may not have occurred at the posted price. In this research, we use a unique data set of actual transaction prices collected from both the electronic and offline markets of buyers in a business-to-business market to evaluate the extent of price dispersion. We find that price dispersion in the electronic market is as low as 0.22%, which is substantially less than that reported in the existing literature. This near-zero price dispersion suggests that in some electronic markets the \u201claw of one price\u201d can prevail when we consider transaction prices, instead of posted prices. We further develop a theoretical framework that identifies several new drivers of price dispersion using transaction data. In particular, we focus on four product-level and market-level attributes\u2014product cost, order cycle time, own price elasticity, and transaction quantity, and we estimate their impact on price dispersion. We also examine the electronic market's moderating role in the relationship between these drivers and price dispersion.

The precision with which the prototype helps a client assess his requirements depends on (a) the type of prototype provided by the vendor and (b) the client's feedback effort. The vendor can provide either a neutral or nonneutral prototype: The nonneutral prototype influences the client towards one particular set of requirements that may not be the true requirement, and the neutral prototype allows the client to assess his true requirements. This leads to the vendor's moral hazard problem. The client chooses to exert either the high or low feedback effort after the vendor provides the prototype. Because the effort is unobservable to the vendor, it can lead to the client exerting the low feedback effort: the client's commitment problem. In this paper we develop and discuss the role of the contract payment to provide the vendor with incentives to supply the neutral prototype, as well as for the client to commit to the high feedback effort. In this setting, we also examine the \u201canchoring\u201d effect, wherein even a high-feedback effort can influence the client more toward a particular set of requirements with the nonneutral prototype.

In spite of many potential benefits of this model, ASPs experienced business failure and high rates of exit.

We test this prediction using a unique data set combining multiple sources that allows us to track an ASP from the year of founding through the beginning of 2006. Contractual misalignment, or adopting contracts mismatched with the underlying agency costs, significantly lowers the probability of survival of service providers in the ASP marketplace. The impact of misalignment is particularly severe when coupled with adjustment costs that impede the transition to aligned contracts. To account for potential heterogeneity in ASPs' knowledge of contracting, we test for endogenous self-selection of ASPs in the relationship between contractual misalignment and survival.

This traditional view of P2P networks is changing, however, and the use of P2P networks has been suggested for delivering general-purpose content over the Web (or corporate intranets), even in real time. We analyze sharing in a P2P community in this new context under three different congestion measures: delay, jitter, and packet loss. Sharing is important to study in the presence of congestion because most existing research on P2P networks views congestion in the network as a relatively insignificant criterion. However, when delivering general-purpose content, congestion and its relationship to sharing is a critical factor that influences end-user performance. This paper looks at P2P networks from this new perspective by explicitly considering the effects of congestion on user incentives for sharing.

The key proposition in this paper is that the relationship between environmental uncertainty and decentralization in IT infrastructure governance is best characterized as a curvilinear relationship.

Although there are studies based on anecdotal evidence and self-reported data on how automation impacts medical errors, no systematic studies exist that are based on actual error rates from hospitals. Further, there is no systematic evidence on how incremental automation over time and across multiple wards impacts the rate of medical errors. The primary objective of our study is to fill this gap in the literature by empirically examining how the automation of core error prevention functions affects two types of medical errors. We draw on the medical informatics literature and principal-agency theory and use a unique panel data set of actual documented medical errors from two major hospitals to analyze the interplay between automation and medical errors. We hypothesize that the automation of the sensing function (recording and observing agent actions) will have the greatest impact on reducing error rates. We show that there are significant complementarities between quality management training imparted to hospital staff and the automation of control systems in reducing interpretative medical errors. We also offer insights to practitioners and theoreticians alike on how the automation of error prevention functions can be combined with training in quality management to yield better outcomes.

Various information systems (IS) projects have been undertaken to enhance public health capacity for detecting EID in a timely manner and disseminating important public health information to concerned parties. While those initiatives seemed to offer promising solutions, public health researchers and practitioners raised concerns about their overall effectiveness. In this paper, we argue that the concerns about current public health IS projects are partially rooted in the lack of a comprehensive framework that captures the complexity of EID management to inform and evaluate the development of public health IS. We leverage loose coupling to analyze news coverage and contact tracing data from 479 patients associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Taiwan. From this analysis, we develop a framework for outbreak management. Our proposed framework identifies two types of causal circles\u2014coupling and decoupling circles\u2014between the central public health administration and the local capacity for detecting unusual patient cases. These two circles are triggered by important information-centric activities in public health practices and can have significant influence on the effectiveness of EID management. We derive seven design guidelines from the framework and our analysis of the SARS outbreak in Taiwan to inform the development of public health IS. We leverage the guidelines to evaluate current public health initiatives. By doing so, we identify limitations of existing public health IS, highlight the direction future development should consider, and discuss implications for research and public health policy."}, "22/3/article4": {"year": "2011", "volume": "22", "issue": "3", "title": "The Digitization of Healthcare: Boundary Risks, Emotion, and Consumer Willingness to Disclose Personal Health Information", "authors": ["Catherine L.

There is little else that is as consequential to an individual as his or her health. In this context, the privacy of one's personal health information has escalated as a matter of significant concern for the public. We pose the question: under what circumstances will individuals be willing to disclose identified personal health information and permit it to be digitized? Using privacy boundary theory and recent developments in the literature related to risk-as-feelings as the core conceptual foundation, we propose and test a model explicating the role played by type of information requested (general health, mental health, genetic), the purpose for which it is to be used (patient care, research, marketing), and the requesting stakeholder (doctors/hospitals, the government, pharmaceutical companies) in an individual's willingness to disclose personal health information. Furthermore, we explore the impact of emotion linked to one's health condition on willingness to disclose. Results from a nationally representative sample of over 1,000 adults underscore the complexity of the health information disclosure decision and show that emotion plays a significant role, highlighting the need for re-examining the timing of consent. Theoretically, the study extends the dominant cognitive-consequentialist approach to privacy by incorporating the role of emotion. It further refines the privacy calculus to incorporate the moderating influence of contextual factors salient in the healthcare setting.

In this context, we find that an independent PHR platform can create incentives for the providers to share their patients' records electronically with other providers by selectively subsidizing them.

We examine the effects of IS avoidance on patient care delivered by health-care groups across three levels of analysis: the individual level, the shared group level, and the configural group level. We find that IS avoidance is significantly and negatively related to patient care only at the configural group level, which suggests that patient care is not degraded by the number of doctors and/or nurses in a group avoiding a system, but rather by their locations in the group's workflow network configuration.

This study examines learning curves in an IT-PRS setting to determine whether agents achieve performance improvements from cumulative experience at different rates and how information technologies transform the learning dynamics in this setting. We present a hierarchical Bayes model that accounts for different agent skills (domain and system) and estimate learning rates for three types of referral requests: emergency (EM), nonemergency (NE), and nonemergency out of network (NO). Furthermore, the model accounts for learning spillovers among the three referral request types and the impact of system upgrade on learning rates. We estimate this model using data from more than 80,000 referral requests to a large IT-PRS. We find that: (1) The IT-PRS exhibits a learning rate of 4.5% for EM referrals, 7.2% for NE referrals, and 12.3% for NO referrals. This is slower than the learning rate of manufacturing (on average 20%) and more comparable to other service settings (on average, 8%). (2) Domain and system experts are found to exhibit significantly different learning behaviors. (3) Significant and varying learning spillovers among the three referral request types are also observed. (4) The performance of domain experts is affected more adversely in comparison to system experts immediately after system upgrade.

We develop an analytical model in which a variety of factors are balanced to best manage the detection component within information security management. The approach not only considers conventional factors such as detection rate and false-positive rate, but also factors associated with hacker behavior that occur in response to improvements in the detection system made by the firm. Detection can be improved by increasing the system's discrimination ability (i.e., the ability to distinguish between attacks and normal usage) through the application of maintenance effort. The discrimination ability deteriorates over time due to changes in the environment. Also, there is the possibility of sudden shocks that can sharply degrade the discrimination ability. The firm's cost increases as hackers become more knowledgeable by disseminating security knowledge within the hacker population. The problem is solved to reveal the presence of a steady-state solution in which the level of system discrimination ability and maintenance effort are held constant. We find an interesting result where, under certain conditions, hackers do not benefit from disseminating security knowledge among one another. In other situations, we find that hackers benefit because the firm must lower its detection rate in the presence of knowledge dissemination. Other insights into managing detection systems are provided. For example, the presence of security shocks can increase or decrease the optimal discrimination level as compared to the optimal level without shocks."}, "22/3/article12": {"year": "2011", "volume": "22", "issue": "3", "title": "Determining Optimal CRM Implementation Strategies", "authors": ["Seung Hyun KimDepartment of Information Systems, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117417", "Tridas MukhopadhyayTepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213"], "keywords": ["  customer relationship management ", " IT investments ", " CRM costs ", " consumer surplus ", " complementarity ", " substitutability ", " economics of IS "], "abstract": "Although companies have spent a great deal of money to adopt CRM (customer relationship management) technologies, many have not seen satisfactory returns on their CRM implementations.

While targeting CRM improves the success rate of distinguishing between nonloyal and loyal customers, support CRM increases the probability of retaining the loyalty of existing customers. We also consider the costs of implementing each CRM type separately as well as both types simultaneously. We show that the optimal CRM implementation strategy depends on the initial mass of loyal customers and diseconomies of scale in simultaneous implementation.

A review of personalization research confirms that little work has been done on these timing issues in the context of personalized services. The current study aims to fill that gap.

Developers in the medium learning state benefit the most through discussions that they initiate. On the other hand, developers in the low and the high states benefit the most by participating in discussions started by others. While in the low state, developers depend entirely upon their peers to learn, whereas in the medium or high state, they can also draw upon their own experiences.

Many product purchase choices for which RAs are used require users to make trade-offs among conflicting product attributes. A key feature of RAs, the preference elicitation method (PEM), often compels users to make explicit trade-offs. We examine whether an RA's PEM generates trade-off difficulty, which, in turn, affects users' evaluations (i.e., perceived amount of effort and perceived accuracy of recommendations) and the resultant acceptance of the RA. Trade-off difficulty influences users' evaluations of an RA via perceived control over execution of the RA PEM. In addition, the decision context in which users employ a PEM moderates the degree to which that PEM generates trade-off difficulty. Specifically, a PEM generates a greater degree of trade-off difficulty in a choice context that leads to a loss than in a choice context that leads to a gain. Consequently, users exert more effort to cope with trade-off difficulty in a loss condition. Because users voluntarily spend more effort, the negative influence of perceived effort on users' acceptance of an RA\u2014which is supported in prior studies\u2014decreases in a loss condition.

The networked structure of interactions on YouTube and the tremendous variation in the success of videos posted online lends itself to an inquiry of the role of social influence. Using a unique data set of video information and user information collected from YouTube, we find that social interactions are influential not only in determining which videos become successful but also on the magnitude of that impact. We also find evidence for a number of mechanisms by which social influence is transmitted, such as (i) a preference for conformity and homophily and (ii) the role of social networks in guiding opinion formation and directing product search and discovery. Econometrically, the problem in identifying social influence is that individuals' choices depend in great part upon the choices of other individuals, referred to as the reflection problem. Another problem in identification is to distinguish between social contagion and user heterogeneity in the diffusion process.

In this study, we contribute to the literature by comprehensively examining the contribution of IT to innovation production across multiple contexts using a quality-based measure of innovation output. Analyzing annual information from 1987 to 1997 for a panel of large U.S. manufacturing firms, we find that a 10% increase in IT input is associated with a 1.7% increase in innovation output for a given level of innovation-related spending. This relationship between IT, research and development (R&D), and innovation production is robust across multiple econometric methodologies and is found to be particularly strong in the mid to late 1990s, a period of rapid technological innovation. Our results also demonstrate the importance of IT in creating value at an intermediate stage of production, in this case, through improved innovation productivity.

When introducing a new product, a software vendor may employ behavior-based price discrimination (BBPD) by offering a discount over its market price to entice existing customers of the competitor. This type of pricing is referred to as competitive upgrade discount pricing and is possible because the vendor can use proof of purchase of a competitor's product as credible evidence to offer the discount. At the same time, the competitor may offer a discount to its own previous customers in order to induce them to buy its upgrade. We formulate a game-theoretic model involving an incumbent and entrant where both firms can offer discounts to existing customers of the incumbent. Although several equilibrium possibilities exist, we establish that an equilibrium with competitive upgrade discount pricing is observed only for a unique market structure and a corresponding unique set of prices. In this equilibrium, instead of leveraging its first mover advantage, the incumbent cedes market share to the entrant. Furthermore, the profits of both the incumbent and the entrant reduce with switching costs. This implies that the use of BBPD has product design implications because firms may influence the switching costs between their products by making appropriate compatibility decisions. In addition, lower switching costs result in reduced consumer surplus. Hence, a social planner may want to increase switching costs. The resulting policy implications are different from those prevalent in other industries such as mobile telecommunications where the regulators reduced switching costs by enforcing number portability."}, "23/1/article5": {"year": "2012", "volume": "23", "issue": "1", "title": "Effects of Information Revelation Policies Under Cost Uncertainty", "authors": ["Karthik N.

Correspondingly, outsourcing contracts typically specify a variety of metrics to measure and reward (or penalize) vendor performance. The specific types of performance metrics included in a contract strongly affect its incentive content and ultimately its outcome. One specific challenge is the measurement of performance when an outsourcing arrangement has a mix of objectives, some that are highly measurable and others that are not. Recent advances in contract theory suggest that the design of incentives for a given objective is affected by the characteristics of other objectives. However, there is little empirical work that demonstrates how relevant these \u201cmultitask\u201d concerns are in real-world contracts. We apply contract theory to examine how objectives and incentives are related in IT outsourcing contracts that include multiple objectives with varying measurement costs. In our context, contracts generally share the objective of reducing IT costs but vary in the importance of increasing IT quality. We establish empirical results about performance measurement in IT outsourcing contracts that are consistent with recent theoretical propositions. We find that the use of strong direct incentives for a given measurable objective is negatively correlated with the presence of less measurable objectives in the contract. We show that outsourcing contracts that emphasize goals with high measurement costs employ more performance metrics than initiatives whose objectives have a lower measurement cost profile. Surprisingly, as the number of performance metrics increases, satisfactory outcomes decrease, which we explain within a multitask theory framework.

We use a data set that contains information for millions of records of airline ticket sales in both online and offline channels. The results suggest that consumer demand in the Internet channel is more price elastic for both transparent and opaque online travel agencies (OTAs), in part, because of more leisure travelers self-selecting the online channel, relative to business travelers.

Consequently, it is hard for online services to know what lock-in strategies to use and when to apply them. We address this problem by first developing a theory-driven structure of online users' perceived switching costs that distinguishes between vendor-related and user-related factors. We then propose that important antecedent influences on switching costs from economic value, technical self-efficacy, and past investments are more complex and intertwined than previously thought. We empirically validated the proposed model using data collected from home users of Internet service providers. Our findings demonstrate that an online service's economic value more heavily influences users' perceptions of vendor-related switching costs than does technical self-efficacy. However, users' technical abilities outweigh economic value in influencing user-related switching costs. Furthermore, although we confirmed the commonly held notion that deeply invested users are generally more vulnerable to lock-in, we also found that this relationship is contingent on users' technical abilities. Finally, we found that our multidimensional measure of switching costs is a valid predictor of user loyalty and is more powerful than previous global measures.

The presented mixture model-based algorithm uses the component rating dependency structure discovered by a structure learning algorithm. The structure is supported by the psychometric literature on the halo effect. This algorithm is compared with a set of model-based and instance-based algorithms for single-component ratings and their variations for multicomponent ratings. We evaluate the algorithms using data from Yahoo! Movies. Use of multiple components leads to significant improvements in recommendations. However, we find that the choice of algorithm depends on the sparsity of the training data. It also depends on whether the task of the algorithm is to accurately predict ratings or to retrieve relevant items. In our experiments a model-based multicomponent rating algorithm is able to better retrieve items when training data are sparse. However, if the training data are not sparse, or if we are trying to predict the rating values accurately, then the instance-based multicomponent rating collaborative filtering algorithms perform better. Beyond generating recommendations we show that the proposed model can fill in missing rating components.

In particular, we acknowledge the distinction between the nonoverlapping classes of basic consumers, who only subscribe to voice plans, and sophisticated consumers, who adopt both services. We also account for the fact that, unlike voice services, data services rapidly evolved over time due to factors such as interface improvement, gradual technological advances in data transmission speed and security, and the increase in volume and diversity of the content and services ported to mobile Internet. Moreover, we consider the time gap between the market introduction of these services and allow for different corresponding consumer learning curves. We test our model on the Japanese wireless market. The empirical analysis reveals several interesting results. In addition to an expected one-way effect of voice on data adoption at the market potential level, we do find two-way codiffusion effects at the speed of adoption level. We also observe that basic consumers impact the adoption of wireless voice services in a stronger way compared to sophisticated consumers. This, in turn, leads to a decreasing average marginal network effect of voice subscribers on the adoption of wireless voice services. Furthermore, we find that the willingness of voice consumers to consider adopting data services is positively related to both time and penetration of 3G-capable handsets among voice subscribers."}, "23/2/article1": {"year": "2012", "volume": "23", "issue": "2", "title": "Are New IT-Enabled Investment Opportunities Diminishing for Firms?", "authors": ["Brian L.

Moreover, the magnitude of IT spillovers is related to relative industry concentration: A 1% decrease in a customer's relative industry concentration increases spillovers by roughly 1%. Thus, further increases in IT capital can be justified along the supply chain, and an industry's relative concentration\u2014which can reflect market power\u2014in part determines the distribution of productivity benefits."}, "23/2/article5": {"year": "2012", "volume": "23", "issue": "2", "title": "Cooperative Cashing?

Controlling duplication of documents across cooperating caches is a challenging problem faced by cache managers. In this paper, we study the economics of document duplication in strategic and nonstrategic settings. We have three primary findings. First, we find that the optimum level of duplication at a cache is nondecreasing in intercache latency, cache size, and extent of request locality. Second, in situations in which cache peering spans organizations, we find that the interaction between caches is a game of strategic substitutes wherein a cache employs lesser resources towards eliminating duplicate documents when the other caches employs more resources towards eliminating duplicate documents at that cache. Thus, a significant challenge will be to simultaneously induce multiple caches to contribute more resources towards reducing duplicate documents in the system. Finally, centralized decision making, which as expected provides improvements in average latency over a decentralized setup, can entail highly asymmetric duplication levels at the caches. This in turn can benefit one set of users at the expense of the other, and thus will be challenging to implement."}, "23/2/article6": {"year": "2012", "volume": "23", "issue": "2", "title": "Institutional Contradictions and Loose Coupling: Postimplementation of NASA's Enterprise Information System", "authors": ["Nicholas BerenteTerry College of Business, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602", "Youngjin YooFox School of Business, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19122"], "keywords": ["  institutional pluralism ", " institutional contradiction ", " institutional logic ", " institutional theory ", " loose coupling ", " loosely coupled ", " enterprise systems ", " ERP ", " NASA "], "abstract": "Through a grounded analysis of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA's) enterprise information system (IS) implementation in the months immediately following the go-live, we show how NASA can be characterized as an institutionally plural organization, rife with diverse institutional logics, some consistent and some contradictory to each other.

The present research effort posits that these mixed findings may potentially be explained by two factors: (1) CRM technology use may have different effects on different customers, and (2) different CRM tools may have different performance consequences. This study investigates this possibility by building on relationship marketing and management theory to propose and test a model of the customer- and firm-level consequences of the organizational use of CRM interaction support and customer prioritization tools. The results of data analysis of 295 customer firms nested within 10 provider firms reveal that firm use of CRM interaction support tools is positively related to customers' relationship perceptions, regardless of customer account size. In contrast, the data indicate that use of CRM prioritization tools appears to have positive effects on a firm's larger customers and negative effects on smaller customers. The results also suggest that when considered at an aggregate level, customer perceptions of the exchange relationship are predictive of organizational performance and that the association between these two variables is significant for larger customer accounts but insignificant for smaller accounts. Overall, the study's results help explain some of the inconsistent findings reported in the literature regarding the performance implications of CRM technology use and suggest that use of the technology may serve to enhance organizational performance, at least over the short term."}, "23/2/article9": {"year": "2012", "volume": "23", "issue": "2", "title": "Reputation and Uncertainty in Online Markets: An Experimental Study", "authors": ["Sarah C.

We propose a scheme for caching fragments of service response messages to improve performance and service quality in service-oriented architectures. In our fragment caching scheme, we decompose responses into smaller fragments such that reusable components can be identified and cached in the XML routers of an XML overlay network within an enterprise network. Such caching mitigates processing requirements on providers and moves content closer to users, thus reducing bandwidth requirements on the network as well as improving service times. We describe the system architecture and caching algorithm details for our caching scheme, develop an analysis of the expected benefits of our scheme, and present the results of both simulation and case study-based experiments to show the validity and performance improvements provided by our caching scheme. Our simulation experimental results show an up to 60% reduction in bandwidth consumption and up to 50% response time improvement. Further, our case study experiments demonstrate that when there is no resource bottleneck, the cache-enabled case reduces average response times by 40%\u201350% and increases throughput by 150% compared to the no-cache and full message caching cases. In experiments contrasting fragment caching and full message caching, we found that full message caching provides benefits when the number of possible unique responses is low while the benefits of fragment caching increase as the number of possible unique responses increases.

Many firms introduce electronic channels in addition to their traditional sales channels but find that buyer usage of the e-channel over time does not keep up with initial expectations. Firms must understand the underlying factors that drive channel usage and how these factors change over time and across buyers. Using panel data pertaining to the purchase histories of 683 buyers over a 43-month period, we estimate a dynamic discrete choice model in a B2B setting that (i) recognizes how price, channel inertia, and inventory change over time; (ii) allows buyers to dynamically trade off these factors when making e-channel adoption decisions; and (iii) takes into account buyer heterogeneity. We find that channel usage is both heterogeneous and dynamic across buyers. Our findings reveal the dynamic tradeoff between channel inertia and the adverse price effect, which interact in opposing directions as the e-channel grows more popular over time: price increases resulting from more bids deter buyers, whereas channel inertia built from sampling experience helps retain repeat buyers for the new channel. Second, we find that the buyers' size and diversity influence purchase decisions, and the e-channel appears more attractive to small and/or diversified buyers. Based on our analysis, we postulate that the seller's allocation decisions of products across channels, if not aligned with buyer behavior, can alienate some buyers. Based on the parameter estimates from the buyer response model, we propose an improved channel allocation that enables firms to selectively attract more buyers to the e-channel and improve revenues. Channel acceptance increases as a result of smart allocation when firms understand and account for individual buyers' channel usage behavior."}, "23/4/article8": {"year": "2012", "volume": "23", "issue": "4", "title": "Ushering Buyers into Electronic Channels: An Empirical Analysis", "authors": ["Hee-Woong KimGraduate School of Information, Yonsei University, Seodeamun, Seoul 120-749, Korea", "Hock Chuan ChanDepartment of Information Systems, School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117417, Republic of Singapore", "Atreyi KankanhalliDepartment of Information Systems, School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117417, Republic of Singapore"], "keywords": ["  digital item purchase ", " virtual community ", " desire for online self-presentation ", " VC norms ", " VC involvement ", " online presentation self-efficacy "], "abstract": "The sale of digital items, such as avatars and decorative objects, is becoming an important source of revenue for virtual community (VC) websites.

We consider a game-theoretic model in which two firms bid for sponsored advertising slots provided by a monopolistic search engine and then compete for consumers in price in the product market. Firms are asymmetrically differentiated in market preference and are given different exposure in organic listing aligned with their market appeal. We identify two aspects of a firm's sponsored bidding incentive, namely, the promotive and the preventive incentives. The presence of organic listing alters firms' sponsored bidding incentives such that the stronger firm has primarily preventive incentive, whereas the weaker has mainly promotive incentive. We show that the preventive incentive decreases and the promotive incentive increases as the difference in firms' market appeal decreases, and as a result, even the weaker firm may outbid the stronger competitor under such a co-listing setting. We further examine how the presence of organic listing affects the equilibrium outcomes by comparing it with a benchmark case in which there is only a sponsored list. We show that the differentiated exposure in the organic list gives the weaker advertiser chances to win a better sponsored position, which improves the overall information structure the search engine provides. As a result, the equilibrium social welfare, sales diversity, and consumer surplus increase.

In this paper, we complement an emerging body of research on the engineering of word-of-mouth effects by exploring a different angle through which firms can strategically exploit the value-generation potential of the user network. Namely, we consider how software firms should optimize the strength of network effects at utility level by adjusting the level of embedded social media features in tandem with the right market seeding and pricing strategies in the presence of seeding disutility. We explore two opposing seeding cost models where seeding-induced disutility can be either positively or negatively correlated with customer type. We consider both complete and incomplete information scenarios for the firm. Under complete information, we uncover a complementarity relationship between seeding and building social media features that holds for both disutility models. When the cost of any of these actions increases, rather than compensating by a stronger action on the other dimension to restore the overall level of network effects, the firm will actually scale back on the other initiative as well. Under incomplete information, this complementarity holds when seeding disutility is negatively correlated with customer type but may not always hold in the other disutility model, potentially leading to fundamentally different optimal strategies. We also discuss how our insights apply to asymmetric networks."}, "24/1/article11": {"year": "2013", "volume": "24", "issue": "1", "title": "Engineering Optimal Network Effects via Social Media Features and Seeding in Markets for Digital Goods and Services", "authors": ["J\u00f6rg ClaussenCopenhagen Business School, 2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark", "Tobias KretschmerUniversity of Munich, 80539 Munich, Germany; Ifo Institute, 81679 Munich Germany; and Center for Economic Performance, London WC2A 2AE, UK", "Philip MayrhoferCenter for Digital Technology and Management, 80333 Munich, Germany"], "keywords": ["  app markets ", " social media ", " platform management ", " Facebook "], "abstract": "We study the market for apps on Facebook, the dominant social networking platform, and make use of a rule change by Facebook by which highly engaging apps were rewarded with further opportunities to engage users.

We distinguish between two IOS governance modes, transactional and financial, and develop a mediated-moderation model to explain the factors influencing the governance choices. In our model, the key motivators of IOS governance are the criticality and the replaceability of the resources that firms procure, which affect IOS governance through their influence on the degree of operational integration existing between partners. We hypothesize that while resource criticality will increase the needs for financial and transactional governance because of its positive impact on operational integration, resource replaceability will negatively influence governance needs because of its negative impact on operational integration. Furthermore, technological uncertainty associated with the resources is argued to negatively impact the extent of IOS governance exercised by firms by weakening the positive impact of resource criticality and strengthening the negative impact of resource replaceability on operational integration respectively. We empirically test our model using data gathered from a survey of 159 United States manufacturing firms. Results show that resource criticality positively affects the extent of financial and transactional IOS governance by increasing the need for operational integration, whereas resource replaceability negatively affects them by reducing the need for operational integration. Furthermore, technological uncertainty creates disincentives for IOS governance primarily by weakening the positive influence of resource criticality on operational integration, while no statistically significant effect of technological uncertainty on the relationship between resource replaceability and operational integration was discerned."}, "24/2/article5": {"year": "2013", "volume": "24", "issue": "2", "title": "Ensuring Employees' IT Compliance: Carrot or Stick?", "authors": ["Huigang LiangDepartment of MIS, College of Business, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina 27858", "Yajiong XueDepartment of MIS, College of Business, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina 27858", "Liansheng WuDepartment of Accounting, Guanghua School of Management, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China"], "keywords": ["  organizational control ", " reward ", " punishment ", " regulatory focus ", " promotion focus ", " prevention focus ", " compliance "], "abstract": "With reward (carrot) and punishment (stick) widely applied by organizations to regulate mandatory IT usage, it is imperative to understand how these incentives influence employee compliance behavior.

Nevertheless, efforts are often private and thus both firms and MSSPs can suffer from double moral hazard. Furthermore, the double moral hazard problem in security outsourcing is complicated by the existence of strong externality and the multiclient nature of MSSP services. In this prescriptive research, we first show that the prevailing contract structure in security outsourcing, bilateral refund contract, cannot solve double moral hazard. Adding breach-contingent sunk cost or external payment cannot solve double moral hazard either. Furthermore, positive externality can worsen double moral hazard. We then propose a new contract structure termed multilateral contract and show that it can solve double moral hazard and induce first-best efforts from all contractual parties when an MSSP serves two or more client firms, regardless of the externality. Firm-side externality significantly affects how payments flow under a multilateral contract when a security breach happens. When the number of client firms for an MSSP increases, we show that the contingent payments under multilateral contracts for any security breach scenario can be easily calculated using an additive method, and thus are computationally simple to implement."}, "24/2/article7": {"year": "2013", "volume": "24", "issue": "2", "title": "The Effects of Diversity in Global, Distributed Collectives: A Study of Open Source Project Success", "authors": ["Sherae DanielJoseph M.

We use a diversity lens to study the success of nontraditional virtual work groups exemplified by open source software (OSS) projects. Building on the diversity literature, we propose that three types of diversity (separation, variety, and disparity) influence two critical outcomes for OSS projects: community engagement and market success. We draw on the OSS literature to further suggest that the effects of diversity on market success are moderated by the application development stage. We instantiate the operational definitions of three forms of diversity to the unique context of open source projects. Using archival data from 357 projects hosted on SourceForge, we find that disparity diversity, reflecting variation in participants' contribution-based reputation, is positively associated with success. The impact of separation diversity, conceptualized as culture and measured as diversity in the spoken language and country of participants, has a negative impact on community engagement but an unexpected positive effect on market success. Variety diversity, reflected in dispersion in project participant roles, positively influences community engagement and market success. The impact of diversity on market success is conditional on the development stage of the project. We discuss how the study's findings advance the literature on antecedents of OSS success, expand our theoretical understanding of diversity, and present the practical implications of the results for managers of distributed collectives."}, "24/2/article8": {"year": "2013", "volume": "24", "issue": "2", "title": "The Framing Effects of Multipart Pricing on Consumer Purchasing Behavior of Customized Information Good Bundles", "authors": ["Kim Huat GohDivision of IT and Operations Management, Nanyang Business School, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 639798", "Jesse C.

We propose a model in which a seller sets prices for goods A and B, allowing for the possibility of sequentially revising the price for good B if the buyer reveals a preference for good A by making an initial purchase decision. We derive comparative statics results for the prices of products that have superadditive or subadditive values, and also for the associated profits. We also run simulations for a range of distributions of buyer values, to compare sequential pricing with mixed bundling. The results indicate that information technology-enabled sequential pricing can increase profits relative to mixed bundling or pure components pricing for substitute goods due to a reduction of intraseller competition. We also consider the case of goods with positively or negatively correlated values and find that when sellers can condition the second good's price on the buyer's decision to purchase the first good, sequential pricing increases profits when customer's values for the goods are highly positively correlated."}, "24/2/article11": {"year": "2013", "volume": "24", "issue": "2", "title": "Efficiency with Linear Prices?

The combinatorial clock (CC) auction has become very popular in these markets for its simplicity and for its highly usable price discovery, derived by the use of linear prices. Unfortunately, no equilibrium bidding strategies are known. Given the importance of the CC auction in the field, it is highly desirable to understand whether there are efficient versions of the CC auction providing a strong game theoretical solution concept. So far, equilibrium strategies have only been found for combinatorial auctions with nonlinear and personalized prices for very restricted sets of bidder valuations. We introduce an extension of the CC auction, the CC+ auction, and show that it actually leads to efficient outcomes in an ex post equilibrium for general valuations with only linear ask prices. We also provide a theoretical analysis on the worst case efficiency of the CC auction, which highlights situations in which the CC leads to highly inefficient outcomes. As in other theoretical models of combinatorial auctions, bidders in the field might not be able to follow the equilibrium strategies suggested by the game-theoretical predictions. Therefore, we complement the theoretical findings with results from computational and laboratory experiments using realistic value models. The experimental results illustrate that the CC+ auction can have a significant impact on efficiency compared to the CC auction."}, "24/2/article12": {"year": "2013", "volume": "24", "issue": "2", "title": "Pricing of Wireless Services: Service Pricing vs. Traffic Pricing", "authors": ["Atanu LahiriMichael G.

Many consumer advocates oppose discriminatory pricing across services believing that it enriches carriers at the expense of consumers. The opposition to discrimination has grown significantly, and it has even prompted the U.S. Congress to question executives of some of the biggest carriers. With this ongoing debate on discrimination in mind, we compare two pricing regimes here. One regime, namely, service pricing, involves pricing different services differently. The other one, namely, traffic pricing, involves pricing the traffic (i.e., bytes) transmitted. We show why the common wisdom, that discriminatory pricing across services increases profits and harms consumers, may not always hold.

Threatened by this growth, the information goods industry took legal action by suing the file sharing peer-to-peer networks and the consumers who illegally share copyrighted material on these networks. In this paper we demonstrate that each one of these two actions aimed to fight individual piracy can backfire by providing strategic disadvantage to legal publishers of information goods. In particular, we show that in the presence of commercial piracy (i) a higher population of consumers who are capable of individual piracy can increase a legal publisher's profits; and (ii) a higher detection and prosecution rate for individual piracy can reduce a legal publisher's profits. Both effects can be observed in markets where commercial piracy is suppressed because the legal publisher can be coerced to take a price cut to minimize the loss of market share. The latter effect can also be observed in markets with active commercial piracy presence because the legal publisher can be forced to raise prices and concede market share to piracy. Our results suggest that information goods producers may be better off by considering their copyright protection policies concerning individual piracy from a more strategic point of view."}, "24/2/article14": {"year": "2013", "volume": "24", "issue": "2", "title": "Research Note\u2014An Investigation of the Appropriation of Technology-Mediated Training Methods Incorporating Enactive and Collaborative Learning", "authors": ["Saurabh GuptaDepartment of Management, Coggin School of Business, University of North Florida, Jacksonville, Florida 32224", "Robert BostromMIS Department, Terry College of Business, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602"], "keywords": ["  technology-mediated learning ", " appropriation ", " simulation ", " e-learning ", " training ", " laboratory experiments ", " longitudinal research ", " collaborative learning "], "abstract": "The growth in the application of information technology to student and employee learning underscores the need to understand the impact of technology-mediated learning (TML) methods.

It was also found that the presence of coordination costs is necessary for the sequential interaction between IT and firm size, indicating coordination between and within firms is a major reason for firms to invest in IT and for IT effect to take place on firm size. This study has taken an initial step by attempting to empirically examine dual causality and longitudinal effects between IT and firm size, and to reconcile different theoretical perspectives on the relationship between them.

As the economic potential of these markets is now being realized, they are beginning to go mainstream, a trend reflected by the explicit attention crowdfunding has received in the American Jobs Act as a potential avenue for economic growth, as well as the recent focus that regulators such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have placed upon it. Although the formulation of regulation and policy surrounding crowd-funded markets is becoming increasingly important, the behavior of crowdfunders, an important aspect that must be considered in this formulation effort, is not yet well understood. A key factor that can influence the behavior of crowd funders is information on prior contribution behavior, including the amount and timing of others' contributions, which is published for general consumption. With that in mind, in this study, we empirically examine social influence in a crowd-funded marketplace for online journalism projects, employing a unique data set that incorporates contribution events and Web traffic statistics for approximately 100 story pitches. This data set allows us to examine both the antecedents and consequences of the contribution process. First, noting that digital journalism is a form of public good, we evaluate the applicability of two competing classes of economic models that explain private contribution toward public goods in the presence of social information: substitution models and reinforcement models. We also propose a new measure that captures both the amount and the timing of others' contribution behavior: contribution frequency (dollars per unit time). We find evidence in support of a substitution model, which suggests a partial crowding-out effect, where contributors may experience a decrease in their marginal utility from making a contribution as it becomes less important to the recipient. Further, we find that the duration of funding and, more importantly, the degree of exposure that a pitch receives over the course of the funding process, are positively associated with readership upon the story's publication. This appears to validate the widely held belief that a key benefit of the crowdfunding model is the potential it offers for awareness and attention-building around causes and ventures. This last aspect is a major contribution of the study, as it demonstrates a clear linkage between marketing effort and the success of crowd-funded projects."}, "24/3/article2": {"year": "2013", "volume": "24", "issue": "3", "title": "All Are Not Equal: An Examination of the Economic Returns to Different Forms of Participation in Open Source Software Communities", "keywords": [" open source software", "  signaling theory", "  job matching theory", "  labor economics", "  software industry "], "abstract": "Open source software (OSS) communities live and die with the continuous contributions of programmers who often participate without direct remuneration. An intriguing question is whether such sustained participation in OSS projects yields economic benefits to the participants. Moreover, as participants engage in OSS projects, they take on different roles and activities in the community. This raises additional questions of whether different forms of participation in OSS communities are associated with different economic rewards and, if so, in which contexts. In this paper, we draw upon theories of signaling and job matching to hypothesize that participants who possess \u201cproof\u201d of their skills in OSS projects are financially rewarded for their activities in the labor market. More specifically, we distinguish between participation in OSS communities that is associated with a signaling value for unobserved productivity characteristics and an additional value that accrues to participants whose OSS roles and activities match those in their paid employment. Following a cohort of OSS programmers over a six-year period, we empirically examine the wages and OSS performance of participants in three of the foremost OSS projects operating within the Apache Software Foundation. Controlling for individual characteristics and other wage-related factors, our findings reveal that credentials earned through a merit-based ranking system are associated with as much as an 18% increase in wages. Moreover, we find that participants who have OSS project management responsibilities receive additional financial rewards if their professional job is in IT management. These findings suggest that rank within an OSS meritocracy is a credible and precise signal of participants' productive capacity and that participants' roles and activities in an OSS community have additional financial value when aligned with their paid employment."}, "24/3/article3": {"year": "2013", "volume": "24", "issue": "3", "title": "Networks, Social Influence, and the Choice Among Competing Innovations: Insights from Open Source Software Licenses", "keywords": [" open source software license", "  social networks", "  innovation adoption and diffusion", "  social influence "], "abstract": "Existing research provides little insight into how social influence affects the adoption and diffusion of competing innovative artifacts and how the experiences of organizational members who have worked with particular innovations in their previous employers affect their current organizations' adoption decision.

We test our predictions using a sample of 5,307 open source projects hosted at SourceForge. Our results suggest the most important factor determining a new project's license choice is the type of license chosen by existing projects that are socially closer to it in its inter-project social network. Moreover, we find that prior adopters of a particular license are more infectious in their influence on the license choice of a new project as their size and performance rankings increase. We also find that managers of new projects who have been members of more successful prior OSS projects and who have greater depth and diversity of experience in the OSS community are less susceptible to social influence. Finally, we find a project manager is more likely to adopt a particular license type when his or her project occupies a similar social role as other projects that have adopted the same license.

Because competition can be a driver of efficiency and industries display varying degrees of competitiveness, firm-level efficiency is likely to display considerable heterogeneity. To shed light on these questions, we analyze the economic impact of IT on technical efficiency, a key component of efficiency, in heterogeneous competitive settings. Our study employs a number of econometric techniques, including a stochastic frontier and a generalized method of moments approach, on data from firms in a wide cross-section of industries. We find, after controlling for firm-level heterogeneity and potential endogeneity, that IT is positively associated with gains in technical efficiency but its impact is moderated by the degree of competition. Firms display large variation in their levels of technical efficiency partly because of the heterogeneous market competitiveness conditions they face. In more competitive industries, firms tend to deploy IT more intensively and use it more efficiently. Our study makes a distinct contribution relative to prior studies that have focused on the productivity impacts of IT while assuming perfect competition and not allowing for potential heterogeneity in firm-level efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate that IT and competition are significant determinants of gains in technical efficiency and provide insight into how competition affects the returns to IT investment."}, "24/3/article5": {"year": "2013", "volume": "24", "issue": "3", "title": "Promotional Marketing or Word-of-Mouth?

From this theory, we derive a high-level framework of how effective use and performance evolve, as well as specific models of the nature and drivers of effective use. The models are designed to explain the effective use of any information system and offer unique insights that would not be offered by traditional views, which tend to consider information systems to be just another tool.

With personalization being increasingly perceived as a source of competitive advantage, there is a growing trend toward pursuing technology-enabled personalization strategies in online retailing. However, the choice of a retailer whether or not to select into technology-enabled personalization and its implications for customer loyalty are at best ambiguous. This paper is an attempt to resolve this apparent ambiguity. Specifically, the paper conceptualizes retailer selection into technology-enabled personalization strategies relevant to two steps of an online purchase, namely, transaction personalization strategy and decision personalization strategy, based on the operating characteristics of a retailer. The implications of the retailers' self-selection into technology-enabled personalization strategies for customer loyalty are then empirically investigated with data collected from 422 retailers. Further, based on a counterfactual analysis, the paper reveals the implications of making a normatively incorrect decision with respect to personalization strategy. Contrary to popular belief, the results of this study indicate that personalization may not be uniformly beneficial in terms of customer loyalty to all retailers. Although a majority of retailers pursue transaction personalization and realize benefits by way of improved customer loyalty, we find that the choice of a retailer to pursue decision personalization is self-selected and dependent on idiosyncratic characteristics related to its operating context. Retailers that have relatively large-scale operations, provide greater variety and realize higher customer satisfaction with product selection, and that do not necessarily compete on price (i.e., realize lower customer satisfaction with prices relative to competing retailers) are more likely to pursue the decision personalization strategy. Although some retailers pursue decision personalization because they clearly stand to benefit from doing so, other retailers are better off not following suit.

The unique properties of on-demand services are the conversion of fixed costs to variable costs, removal of capacity constraint, and fast setup time (which enables quick entry by any firm at any time when there is opportunity), whereas privacy and security concerns and switching costs have been noted as the biggest barriers from adopting on-demand services. With a stylized model capturing these benefits and barriers to using on-demand services, we establish several results. First, we show that conversion of fixed cost to variable cost enables new and small firms to enter existing markets and leads to the creation of new markets. Second, we show that competition and the threat of new entrants can be an important driver of a firm's decision to switch to on-demand services. In addition, a firm's barriers to using on-demand services can influence another firm's entry decision. Third, we show that two identical firms may employ different technologies in equilibrium. Fourth, we show that fast setup time and removal of capacity constraint associated with on-demand services make it impossible for firms to make supranormal return and would lead to a perfect competitive market, even when there is only one firm, under very general conditions. Such a result still holds even when there exists an economy of scale (e.g., quantity discount) from using on-demand services. On the other hand, when there are barriers preventing firms from offering similar products and products are substantially differentiated, on-demand services can amplify this advantage of entry barriers by enabling firms to further increase prices and enhance their profitability. Therefore, contrary to the common belief that offering on-demand services is best for firms offering commodity products, we show on-demand services to be more profitable for firms with differentiated products."}, "24/3/article13": {"year": "2013", "volume": "24", "issue": "3", "title": "Ascending Combinatorial Auctions with Allocation Constraints: On Game Theoretical and Computational Properties of Generic Pricing Rules", "keywords": [" electronic markets and auctions", "  economics of IS", "  electronic commerce", "  decision support systems "], "abstract": "Combinatorial auctions are used in a variety of application domains, such as transportation or industrial procurement, using a variety of bidding languages and different allocation constraints.

We investigate the relationship of deadness levels and the simple price update rules used in efficient ascending combinatorial auction formats. We show that ascending combinatorial auctions with deadness level pricing rules maintain a strong game theoretical solution concept and reduce the number of bids and rounds required at the expense of higher computational effort.

Analogous to topical locality, status locality may also be exploited by Web crawlers. Collections built by such crawlers include pages that are both topically relevant and also important. This capability is crucial because of the large numbers of Web pages addressing even niche topics. The challenge in exploiting status locality while crawling is that page importance (or status) is typically recognized through global measures computed by processing link data from billion of pages. In contrast, topical Web crawlers depend on local information based on previously downloaded pages. We solve this problem by using methods developed previously that utilize local characteristics of pages to estimate their global status. This leads to the design of new crawlers, specifically of utility-biased crawlers guided by a Cobb-Douglas utility function. Our crawler experiments show that status and topicality of Web collections present a trade-off. An adaptive version of our utility-biased crawler dynamically modifies output elasticities of topicality and status to create Web collections that maintain high average topicality. This can be done while simultaneously achieving significantly higher average status as compared to several benchmarks including a state-of-the-art topical crawler."}, "24/3/article16": {"year": "2013", "volume": "24", "issue": "3", "title": "Interdependencies in IT Infrastructure Services: Analyzing Service Processes for Optimal Incentive Design", "keywords": [" IT outsourcing", "  service level agreements", "  incentives", "  agency theory", "  process interdependence "], "abstract": "Information technology (IT) infrastructure outsourcing arrangements involve multiple services and processes that are interdependent.

Each of these research streams asks questions that at their core involve \u201cinformation in networks\u201d\u2014its distribution, its diffusion, its inferential value, and its influence on social and economic outcomes. We suggest a broad direction for research into social and economic networks. Our analysis describes four kinds of investigation that seem most promising. The first studies how information technologies create and reveal networks whose connections represent social and economic relationships. The second examines the content that flows through networks and its economic, social, and organizational implications. A third develops theories and methods to understand and utilize the rich predictive information contained in networked data. A final area of inquiry focuses on network dynamics and how information technology affects network evolution. We conclude by discussing several important cross-cutting issues with implications for all four research streams, which must be addressed if the ensuing research is to be both rigorous and relevant.

Based on archival panel data on costs, operations, and patient care outcomes of 66 hospitals in the U.S. state of Washington from 1998 to 2007, we find that past HIT expenditure is negatively associated with MIP, supporting our argument that HIT provides value that is anticipated by insurers and is captured by a change in MIP. We find that past HIT is positively associated with quality of patient care. We also find that past MIP is positively associated with quality of patient care, supporting the premise that hospitals respond to MIP by making risk mitigation efforts.

In our studies, we explore how consumer preferences at the time of consumption are impacted by predictions generated by recommender systems. We conducted three controlled laboratory experiments to explore the effects of system recommendations on preferences. Studies 1 and 2 investigated user preferences for television programs across a variety of conditions, which were surveyed immediately following program viewing. Study 3 investigated the granularity of the observed effects within individual participants. Results provide strong evidence that the rating presented by a recommender system serves as an anchor for the consumer's constructed preference. Viewers' preference ratings are malleable and can be significantly influenced by the recommendation received. The effect is sensitive to the perceived reliability of a recommender system and, thus, not a purely numerical or priming-based effect. Finally, the effect of anchoring is continuous and linear, operating over a range of perturbations of the system.

In their facilitating role, IT competencies should enhance firm performance by helping the implementation of requisite entrepreneurial and adaptive actions. Furthermore, we argue that the effects of the dual roles of IT competencies are moderated by multiple contingencies arising from environmental dynamism and other sources. We test our model and hypotheses through a latent class regression analysis on data from a sample of 109 business-to-business electronic marketplaces.

Our study attempts to fill this gap by using several econometric models to explore the said relationship. Our unique and rich data set from a women's clothing company allows us to measure technology usage at the product level for each consumer. The results show that, in this context, zoom usage has a negative coefficient, suggesting that a higher use of the zoom technology is associated with fewer returns. Interestingly, we find that a higher use of alternative photos is associated with more returns and, perhaps more importantly, with lower net sales. Color swatch, on the other hand, does not seem to have any effect on returns. Thus, our findings show that different technologies have different effects on product returns.

In RO literature, multistage investment programs have been treated as either interproject or intraproject programs, with intraproject programs being evaluated using n-fold Geske compound options and interproject programs valued using the so-called \u201csubsidy-to-exercise price\u201d logic. Our innovative RO model integrates the Geske compound option model with the subsidy-to-exercise price approach to value sequential investment programs that are neither purely interproject nor purely intraproject in nature but are composed of meta-stages. A meta-stage as a whole can be considered an interproject stage resulting in cash flows, but internally it consists of several intraproject stages that do not result in cash flows. We show that a key problem in IT, which is migrating to a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) for integrating a firm's many disparate applications, systems, data, and business processes, is best viewed as an investment program comprising meta-stages. Examining SOA migration from an RO lens is particularly apt at this time not only because of the importance of SOA but also because doubts have surfaced about the value of SOA. We illustrate our RO model by applying it to the simulated case of a firm migrating to SOA. We also develop a software tool based on the MathematicaTM computational platform so that practitioners can easily apply our innovative options pricing model to determine the true value of SOA in their business contexts."}, "24/4/article10": {"year": "2013", "volume": "24", "issue": "4", "title": "Outsourcing Contracts and Equity Prices", "keywords": ["  confirmation bias", "  overconfidence", "  investment decisions", "  virtual communities", "  stock message boards "], "abstract": "We investigate the impact of outsourcing on the long-term market performance of the firm. Outsourcing initiatives vary in terms of uncertainty in business requirements, complexity of coordination between the outsourcing firm and provider, and the consequent choice of the governing contract (fixed or variable price). Using theories from institutional economics, strategy, and information systems, we argue that firms pursuing large-scale, fixed price outsourcing, which are characterized by lower business uncertainty and simpler coordination requirements, will realize higher market returns relative to similar firms in the same industry who did not outsource. In contrast, variable price contracts that proxy for higher business uncertainty and coordination complexity may have a higher risk of failure and loss of shareholder value; however, prior outsourcing experience and prior association with the vendor may reduce uncertainty in the outsourcing relationship to help the outsourcing firm better manage challenges associated with complex, variable price engagements. We posit that financial markets are either not privy to or unlikely to accurately interpret such intangible information on the antecedents of outsourcing success during the announcement period. The delay in incorporation of this information in market prices results in positive long-term abnormal returns to fixed price contracts. Variable price contracts characterized by prior association between participant firms and greater outsourcing experience also realize positive long-term abnormal returns. Data on the hundred largest outsourcing initiatives implemented between 1996 and 2005 strongly support our hypotheses. The results imply that firms who retain simple functions and tasks in-house as well as those who outsource complex functions without pertinent experience or association with the vendor experience significant loss of shareholder value."}, "24/4/article11": {"year": "2013", "volume": "24", "issue": "4", "title": "Information Valuation and Confirmation Bias in Virtual Communities: Evidence from Stock Message Boards", "keywords": ["  analytical modeling", "  competitive impacts of IS", "  economics of IS "], "abstract": "Virtual communities continue to play a greater role in social, political, and economic interactions.

Using data from 502 investor responses from a field experiment on one of the largest message board operators in South Korea, our analyses revealed that investors exhibit confirmation bias, whereby they preferentially treat messages that support their prior beliefs. This behavior is more pronounced for investors with higher perceived knowledge about the market and higher strength of belief (i.e., sentiment) toward a particular stock. We also find a negative interaction effect between the perceived knowledge and the strength of prior belief on confirmation bias. Those exhibiting confirmation bias are also more overconfident; as a result, they trade more actively and expect higher market returns than is warranted.

Studies of IT spillovers often adopt a \u201cproduction function\u201d approach commonly used for measuring R&D spillovers, in which an external pool of IT investment is modeled using weighted measures of the IT investments of other firms, industries, or countries. We show that when using this approach, measurement error in a firm's own IT inputs can exert a significant upward bias on estimates of social returns to IT investment. This problem is particularly severe for IT spillovers because of the high levels of measurement error in most available IT data. The presence of the bias term can be demonstrated by using instrumental variable techniques to remove the effects of measurement error in a firm's own IT inputs. Using panel data on IT investment, we show that measurement error corrected estimates of IT spillovers are 40% to 90% lower than uncorrected estimates.

We find commonalities and differences in the influence coordination mechanisms have on contextual ambidexterity from the vendor's and the customer's perspectives. For both customers and vendors, contextual ambidexterity improves the quality and performance of the relationship, and decision interdependence promotes contextual ambidexterity. For customers, using operations support systems (OSSs) and interpretation support systems (ISSs) enhances contextual ambidexterity. For vendors, the impact of both OSS use and ISS use on contextual ambidexterity depends on the duration of the relationship.

Online product reviews provide additional information for consumers to mitigate the uncertainty about the quality of a product and about its fit to consumers' needs. We show that the effect of reviews on the upstream competition between the manufacturers is critical in understanding which firms gain and which firms lose. The upstream competition is affected in fundamentally different ways by quality information and fit information, and each information type has different implications for the retailer and manufacturers. Quality information homogenizes consumers' perceived utility differences between the two products and increases the upstream competition, which benefits the retailer but hurts the manufacturers. Fit information heterogenizes consumers' estimated fits to the products and softens the upstream competition, which hurts the retailer but benefits the manufacturers. Furthermore, reviews may also alter the nature of upstream competition from one in which consumers' own assessment on the quality dimension plays a dominant role in consumers' comparative evaluation of products to one in which fit dimension plays a dominant role. If manufacturers do not respond strategically to reviews and keep the same wholesale prices regardless of reviews (i.e., the upstream competition is assumed to be unaffected by reviews), then, we show that reviews never hurt the retailer and the manufacturer with favorable reviews, and never benefit the manufacturer with unfavorable reviews, a finding that demonstrates why reviews' effect on upstream competition is critical for firms in online marketplaces."}, "25/1/article7": {"year": "2014", "volume": "25", "issue": "1", "title": "A Framework and Guidelines for Context-Specific Theorizing in Information Systems Research", "authors": ["Weiyin HongDepartment of ISOM, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong; and Lee Business School, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada 89120", "Frank K.

The customer support center's costly efforts at joint product improvement include transcribing and analyzing customer feedback, analyzing market trends, and investing in product design. Yet this cooperative role must be adequately incentivized by the client, since it could lead to fewer service requests and hence lower revenues for the customer support center. We model this problem as a sequential game with double-sided moral hazard in a principal-agent framework (in which the client is the principal). We follow the contracting literature in modeling the effort of the customer support center, which is the first mover, as either unobservable or observable; in either case, the efforts are unverifiable and so cannot be contracted on directly. We show that it is optimal for the client to offer the customer support center a linear gain-share contract when efforts are unobservable, even though it can yield only the second-best solution for the client. We also show that the cost-plus contracts widely used in practice do not obtain the optimal solution. However, we demonstrate that if efforts are observable then a gain-share and cost-plus options- based contract is optimal and will also yield the first-best solution.

In particular, we focus on two emerging software business models that involve a free component: feature-limited freemium (FLF) and uniform seeding (S). Under FLF, the firm offers the basic software version for free, while charging for premium features. Under S, the firm gives away for free the full product to a percentage of the addressable market uniformly across consumer types. We benchmark their performance against a conventional business model under which software is sold as a bundle (labeled as \u201ccharge for everything\u201d or CE) without free offers. In the context of consumer bounded rationality and information asymmetry, we develop a unified two-period consumer valuation learning framework that accounts for both word-of-mouth (WOM) effects and experience-based learning, and use it to compare and contrast the three business models. Under both constant and dynamic pricing, for moderate strength of WOM signals, we derive the equilibria for each model and identify optimality regions. In particular, S is optimal when consumers significantly underestimate the value of functionality and cross-module synergies are weak. When either cross-module synergies are stronger or initial priors are higher, the firm decides between CE and FLF. Furthermore, we identify nontrivial switching dynamics from one optimality region to another depending on the initial consumer beliefs about the value of the embedded functionality. For example, there are regions where, ceteris paribus, FLF is optimal when the prior on premium functionality is either relatively low or high, but not in between. We also demonstrate the robustness of our findings with respect to various parameterizations of cross-module synergies, strength of WOM effects, and number of periods. We find that stronger WOM effects or more periods lead to an expansion of the seeding optimality region in parallel with a decrease in the seeding ratio. Moreover, under CE and dynamic pricing, second period price may be decreasing in the initial consumer valuation beliefs when WOM effects are strong and the prior is relatively low. However, this is not the case under weak WOM effects. We also discuss regions where price skimming and penetration pricing are optimal.

Our data include project and personnel level archival data on 530 projects completed by 209 PMs. We employ the critical incidents methodology to assess the PI of the PMs who led these projects. Our findings indicate that PMs' PI has a significant and positive impact on project performance. Further, projects with higher complexity or lower familiarity benefit even more from PMs' PI. Our study extends the literatures on project management and outsourcing by conceptualizing and measuring PMs' PI, by theorizing its relationship with project performance, and by positing how that relationship is moderated by project complexity and familiarity.

Despite the prevalence of these service technologies and the scholarly recognition of their importance, surprisingly little empirical research has examined the fundamental differences among them. Consequently, little is known about the factors that may favor the use of one type of service technology over another. In this paper, we propose the Model of Online Service Technologies (MOST) to theorize that the capacity of a service provider to accommodate the variability of customer inputs into the service process is the key difference among various types of service technologies. We posit two types of input variability: Service Provider-Elicited Variability (SPEV), where variability is determined in advance by the service provider; and User-Initiated Variability (UIV), where customers determine variability in the service process. We also theorize about the role of task complexity in changing the effectiveness of service technologies. We then empirically investigate the impact of service technologies that possess different capacities to accommodate input variability on efficiency and personalization, the two competing goals of service adoption. Our empirical approach attempts to capture both the perspective of the vendor who may deploy such technologies, as well as the perspective of customers who might choose among service technology alternatives. Our findings reveal that SPEV technologies (i.e., technologies that can accommodate SPEV) are more efficient, but less personalized, than SPEUIV technologies (i.e., technologies that can accommodate both SPEV and UIV). However, when task complexity is high (vs. low), the superior efficiency of SPEV technologies is less prominent, while both SPEV and SPEUIV technologies have higher personalization. We also find that when given a choice, a majority of customers tend to choose to use both types of technologies. The results of this study further our understanding of the differences in efficiency and personalization experienced by customers when using various types of online service technologies. The results also inform practitioners when and how to implement these technologies in the online shopping environment to improve efficiency and personalization for customers."}, "25/3/article1": {"year": "2014", "volume": "25", "issue": "3", "title": "Editorial\u2014Big Data, Data Science, and Analytics: The Opportunity and Challenge for IS Research", "authors": ["Ritu AgarwalCenter for Health Information and Decision Systems, Robert H.

Within the income accounting identity we partition capital into non-IT and IT capital and analytically derive an accounting identity (AI)-based Cobb-Douglas form that both nests the three-input Cobb-Douglas and provides additional terms based on wage rates and rates of return to non-IT and IT capital. To empirically confirm the theoretical derivation, we use a specially constructed data set from a subset of the U.S. manufacturing industry that involve elaborate calculations of rates of return\u2014a data set that is infeasible to obtain for most productivity studies\u2014to estimate the standard Cobb-Douglas and our AI-based form. We find that estimates from our AI-based form correspond with those of the Cobb-Douglas, and our AI-based form has significantly greater explanatory power. In addition, empirical estimation of both forms is relatively robust to the assumption of intertemporally stable input shares required to derive the AI-based form, although there may be limits. Thus, in the context of future research the Cobb-Douglas form and its application in IT productivity work have a theoretically and empirically supported basis in the accounting identity. A poor fit to data or unexpected coefficient estimates suggests problems with data quality or intertemporally unstable input shares. Our work also shows how some returns to IT that do not show up in output elasticities can be found in total factor productivity (TFP)\u2014the novel ways inputs are combined to produce output. The critical insight for future research is that many unobservables that have been considered part of TFP can be manifested in rates of return to IT capital, non-IT capital, and labor\u2014rates of return that are separated from TFP in our AI-based form.

This can greatly increase the value associated with the software. In an environment where negative security externalities are present and users make complex consumption and patching decisions, we construct a model that clarifies whether and how SaaS versions should be offered by vendors. We find that the existence of version-specific security externalities is sufficient to warrant a versioned outcome, which has been shown to be suboptimal in the absence of security risks. In high security-loss environments, we find that SaaS should be geared to the middle tier of the consumer market if patching costs and the quality of the SaaS offering are high, and geared to the lower tier otherwise. In the former case, when security risk associated with each version is endogenously determined by consumption choices, strategic interactions between the vendor and consumers may cause a higher tier consumer segment to prefer a lower inherent quality product. Relative to on-premises benchmarks, we find that software diversification leads to lower average security losses for users when patching costs are high. However, when patching costs are low, surprisingly, average security losses can increase as a result of SaaS offerings and lead to lower consumer surplus. We also investigate the vendor\u2019s security investment decision and establish that, as the market becomes riskier, the vendor tends to increase investments in an on-premises version and decrease investments in a SaaS version. On the other hand, in low security-loss environments, we find that SaaS is optimally targeted to a lower tier of the consumer market, average security losses decrease, and consumer surplus increases as a result.

Drawing on extant theories, we first developed a model of how cumulative outcomes, recent outcomes, and prior use affect online gambling behavior differently. We empirically tested the model using longitudinal panel data collected over eight months from 22,304 actual users of a gambling website. The results of a multilevel panel data analysis strongly supported our hypotheses. First, consistent with gambling theory, individuals' online gambling was found to increase with any increase in a cumulative net gain or cumulative net loss. Second, as the availability heuristic prescribes, a recent loss reduced online gambling, whereas a recent gain increased it. Third, consistent with the literature on repeated behavior, regular use and extended use moderated the relationship between current and subsequent gambling. Taken together, the present study clarifies how people react differently to immediate and cumulative outcomes and also how regular use and extended use facilitate routine behavior in the context of online gambling. In general, our findings suggest that the three perspectives, i.e., gambling theory, the availability heuristic, and repeated behavior, should be taken into account to understand online gambling, which is in essence a series of risk-taking attempts with the potential of eventually becoming routine behavior. This study is expected to offer valuable insights into other types of online games that could engage people in risking real or cyber money and, at the same time, could be easily enmeshed with everyday life (e.g., fantasy sports, online virtual worlds)."}, "25/3/article6": {"year": "2014", "volume": "25", "issue": "3", "title": "The Central Role of Engagement in Online Communities", "authors": ["Zhiqiang (Eric) ZhengJindal School of Management, University of Texas at Dallas, Dallas, Texas 75080", "Paul A.

Design theory generation is increasing in importance because of the increasing number and diversity of problems that require the participation and proactive involvement of academic researchers to build and test artifact-based solutions. However, we have little understanding of how design theories are generated. Drawing on key contributions by Herbert A. Simon, including the ideas of satisfice and bounded rationality and reviewing a large body of information systems and problem-solving literature, we develop a normative framework for proactive design theorizing based on the notion of heuristic theorizing. Heuristics are rules of thumb that provide a plausible aid in structuring the problem at hand or in searching for a satisficing artifact design. An example of a problem-structuring heuristic is problem decomposition and an example of an artifact design heuristic is analogical design. We define heuristic theorizing as the process of proactively generating design theory for prescriptive purposes from problem-solving experiences and prior theory by constantly iterating between the search for a satisficing problem solution, i.e., heuristic search, and the synthesis of new information that is generated during heuristic search, i.e., heuristic synthesis. Heuristic search involves alternating between structuring the problem at hand and generating new artifact design components, whereas heuristic synthesis involves different ways of thinking, including reflection and learning and forms of reasoning, that complement the use of heuristics for theorizing purposes. We illustrate the effectiveness of our heuristic theorizing framework through a detailed example of a multiyear design science research program in which we proactively generated a design theory for solving problems in the area of intelligent information management and so-called big data in the finance domain. We propose that heuristic theorizing is a useful alternative to established theorizing approaches, i.e., reasoning-based approaches. Heuristic theorizing is particularly relevant for proactive design theorizing, which emphasizes problem solving as being highly intertwined with theorizing, involves a greater variety of ways of thinking than other theorizing approaches, and assumes an engaged relationship between academics and practitioners."}, "25/4/article1": {"year": "2014", "volume": "25", "issue": "4", "title": "Editorial Notes", "authors": ["Ritu AgarwalCenter for Health Information and Decision Systems, Robert H.

We draw from research on brand equity and customer loyalty, ICT innovation management, and strategy complementarity to propose a model that includes new constructs representing ICT service innovation, i.e., service leadership, and its two complementary strategies, i.e., customization-personalization control and technology leadership, and how their interactions influence customer loyalty through customer-based brand equity. We test our model using data from an online survey of 1,210 customers of mobile data services. The results show that service leadership and customization-personalization control have significant direct impacts on ICT service providers' brand equity. Moreover, when either the level of technology leadership or the level of customization-personalization control is high, the impact of service leadership on brand equity is enhanced. In turn, brand equity has significant impacts on consumers' affective loyalty and conative loyalty, but not on cognitive loyalty.

We take a coordination perspective and adopt an information processing lens used by prior organization theorists to conceptualize sets of formal structural and informal nonstructural mechanisms, and predict their positive impacts on the strategic IT benefits achieved by the client. Utilizing a strategic alliance lens, we also predict that two characteristics of the client-vendor arrangement will moderate the impacts of both sets of coordination mechanisms. We test our hypotheses using hierarchical regression techniques on field survey data collected from 141 IS managers in client firms, responsible for IS development outsourcing arrangements. We found that the implementation of both structural and informal mechanisms positively impact the client\u2019s strategic IT benefits. In arrangements with greater resource provisioning by the vendor, the positive impacts of informal governance mechanisms are strengthened. In arrangements with higher values similarity, the positive impacts of structural governance mechanisms are strengthened, but the positive impacts of informal mechanisms are weakened. A post-hoc analysis of a mediation model reveals that values similarity also has a positive relationship to both structural and informal governance mechanisms. This study therefore provides empirical support for the validity of an information processing lens to theorize lateral mechanism solutions to the coordination challenges of IS development outsourcing.

The emerging theory suggests that once invisible communication occurring between others in the organization becomes visible for third parties, those third parties could improve their metaknowledge (i.e., knowledge of who knows what and who knows whom). Communication visibility, in this case made possible by the enterprise social networking site, leads to enhanced awareness of who knows what and whom through two interrelated mechanisms: message transparency and network translucence. Seeing the contents of other\u2019s messages helps third-party observers make inferences about coworkers' knowledge. Tangentially, seeing the structure of coworkers' communication networks helps third-party observers make inferences about those with whom coworkers regularly communicate. The emerging theory further suggests that enhanced metaknowledge can lead to more innovative products and services and less knowledge duplication if employees learn to work in new ways. By learning vicariously rather than through experience, workers can more effectively recombine existing ideas into new ideas and avoid duplicating work. Moreover, they can begin to proactively aggregate information perceived daily rather than engaging in reactive search after confronting a problem.

We consider both a structured measure summarized in a numerical reputation score and an unstructured measure based on the verbal praise left by previous buyers, which we encode using text mining techniques. We find that buyers trade off reputation (both structured and unstructured) and price and are willing to accept higher bids posted by more reputable bidders. Sellers also respond to changes in their own reputation through three different channels. They increase their bids with their reputation score (price effect) but primarily use a superior reputation to increase their probability of being selected (volume effect) as opposed to increasing their bid prices. Negative shocks in seller reputation are associated to an increase in the probability of seller exit (exit effect), but this effect is moderated by the investment that the seller has made in the site. We conclude that participants in this market are very responsive to the numerical reputation score and also to the unstructured reputational information, which behaves in a similar way to the structured numerical reputation score but provides complementary information."}, "26/1/article1": {"year": "2015", "volume": "26", "issue": "1", "title": "Health Information Exchange as a Multisided Platform: Adoption, Usage, and Practice Involvement in Service Co-Production", "authors": ["Niam YaraghiCenter for Technology Innovation, Governance Studies, The Brookings Institution, Washington, DC 20036", "Anna Ye DuManagement Science and Systems Department, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York 14260", "Raj SharmanManagement Science and Systems Department, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York 14260", "Ram D.

This unified model enables us to answer three key questions related to the use of predictive analytics methods for patient readmissions: whether a readmission will occur, how often readmissions will occur, and when a readmission will occur.

We find that health IT usage, patient demographics, visit characteristics, payer type, and hospital characteristics, are significantly associated with patient readmission risk. We also observe that implementation of cardiology information systems is associated with a reduction in the propensity and frequency of future readmissions, whereas administrative IT systems are correlated with a lower frequency of future readmissions.

Grounded in our case, we construct a substantive theory of ambidexterity in IT transformation programs that identifies and explains the paradoxes that managers need to resolve in IT transformation programs. The ambidexterity areas we identified are (1) IT portfolio decisions (i.e., IT efficiency versus IT innovation), (2) IT platform design (i.e., IT standardization versus IT differentiation), (3) IT architecture change (i.e., IT integration versus IT replacement), (4) IT program planning (i.e., IT program agility versus IT project stability), (5) IT program governance (i.e., IT program control versus IT project autonomy), and (6) IT program delivery (i.e., IT program coordination versus IT project isolation). What weaves these six areas together is the combined need for IT managers to employ ambidextrous resolution strategies to ensure short-term IT contributions and continuous progress of IT projects while simultaneously working toward IT transformation program success as a foundation for IT-enabled business transformation.

To explore how such imitation unfolds in this sector, we estimate a series of logistic regression models of 116 IT vendors\u2019 service-line choices over three time periods. First, from the strategic imitation literature we identify the key imitation \u201creferents,\u201d which is a group of firms or a single firm with specific traits, and we test the relative influence of each referent. All of our analysis includes these referents as predictors of service-line choice. Next, we tested more nuanced models using theoretically guided subsamples as follows. One, based on information systems (IS) literature, we consider the IT vendors as embedded in three distinct \u201cinstitutional spheres,\u201d each corresponding to a knowledge domain, namely, technical, functional, and vertical industry domains. We separately examine imitation in each subsample corresponding to the three types of service lines. Two, based on strategy literature, we consider that the influence of the imitation referents differs when the choice under consideration is the addition of a new service line versus a withdrawal. Our results across all of these subsamples uncover a nuanced pattern of imitation that sometimes contrasts the full-sample results. The most prominent result is that although imitation is highly salient, the different imitation referents are not universally influential across all knowledge domains and between development versus withdrawal decisions. Specifically, the imitation of similar firms is widespread, whereas the imitation of largest firms or offering popular service-lines, which indicates bandwagon effects, are at play only selectively.

We analyze work histories spanning 28 years for 359 IT professionals drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. We report three major findings. First, as hypothesized, larger relative pay gaps significantly increase the likelihood of job mobility. Second, IT males and IT females have different job mobility patterns. IT males are more likely to turn over than turn away-between when faced with a relative pay gap. Further, and contrary to predictions from human capital theory, IT males are more likely to turn away-within than turn over. This surprising finding suggests that the ubiquitous use of IT in other business functions may have increased the value of IT skills for non-IT jobs and reduced the friction of moving from IT to other non-IT positions. Third, and consistent with stigmatization arguments, IT females are more likely to turn away from IT than to turn over when faced with a relative pay gap.

Its on-demand feature allows users to enjoy full scalability and to handle possible demand fluctuations at no risk. In recent years, SaaS has become an appealing alternative to purchasing, installing, and maintaining modifiable off-the-shelf (MOTS) software packages. We present a game-theoretical model to study the competitive dynamics between the SaaS provider, who charges a variable per-transaction fee, and the traditional MOTS provider. We characterize the equilibrium conditions under which the two coexist in a competitive market and those under which each provider will fail and exit the market. Decreasing the lack-of-fit (or the cross-application data integration) costs of SaaS results in four structural regimes in the market. These are MOTS Dominance \u2192 Segmented Market \u2192 Competitive Market \u2192 SaaS Dominance. Based on our findings, we recommend distinct competitive strategies for each provider. We suggest that the SaaS provider should invest in reducing both its lack-of-fit costs and its per-transaction price so that it can offer increasing economies of scale. The MOTS provider, by contrast, should not resort to a price-cutting strategy; rather, it should enhance software functionality and features to deliver superior value. We further examine this problem from the software life-cycle perspective, with multiple stages over which users can depreciate the fixed costs of installing and customizing their MOTS solutions on site. We then present an analysis that characterizes the competitive outcomes when future technological developments could change the relative levels of the lack-of-fit costs. Specifically, we explain why the SaaS provider will always use a forward-looking pricing strategy: When lack-of-fit costs are expected to decrease (increase) in the future, the SaaS provider should reduce (increase) its current price. This is in contrast with the MOTS provider, who will use the forward-looking pricing strategy only when lack-of-fit costs are expected to increase. Surprisingly, when such costs are expected to decrease, the MOTS provider should ignore this expectation and use the same pricing strategy as in the benchmark with invariant lack-of-fit costs."}, "26/2/article8": {"year": "2015", "volume": "26", "issue": "2", "title": "Social Capital and Contract Duration in Buyer-Supplier Networks for Information Technology Outsourcing", "authors": ["Kiron RavindranIE Business School, University of Madrid, 28006 Madrid, Spain", "Anjana SusarlaMichigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824", "Deepa ManiIndian School of Business, Gachibowli, Hyderabad 500032, India", "Vijay GurbaxaniUniversity of California, Irvine, Irvine, California 92697"], "keywords": ["  social capital", "  reputation", "  IT outsourcing", "  contract design "], "abstract": "This paper presents new evidence on the role of embeddedness in predicting contract duration in the context of information technology outsourcing. Contract duration is a strategic decision that aligns interests of clients and vendors, providing the benefits of business continuity to clients and incentives to undertake relationship specific investments for vendors. Considering the salience of this phenomenon, there has been limited empirical scrutiny of how contract duration is awarded. We posit that clients and vendors obtain two benefits from being embedded in an interorganizational network. First, the learning and experience accumulated from being embedded in a client-vendor network could mitigate the challenges in managing longer term contracts. Second, the network serves as a reputation system that can stratify vendors according to their trustworthiness and reliability, which is important in longer term arrangements. In particular, we attempt to make a substantive contribution to the literature by theorizing about embeddedness at four distinct levels: structural embeddedness at the node level, relational embeddedness at the dyad level, contractual embeddedness at the level of a neighborhood of contracts, and finally, positional embeddedness at the level of the entire network. We analyze a data set of 22,039 outsourcing contracts implemented between 1989 and 2008. We find that contract duration is indeed associated with structural and positional embeddedness of participant firms, with the relational embeddedness of the buyer-seller dyad, and with the duration of other contracts to which it is connected through common firms. Given the nature of our data, identification using traditional ordinary least squares based approaches is difficult given the unobserved errors clustered along two nonnested dimensions and the autocorrelation in a firm\u2019s decision (here the contract) with those of contracts in its reference group.

To ascertain whether the D-W-A effect can be triggered through the use of distracting website features in the context of online shopping, two experiments are conducted. The first experiment reveals that the presence of distracting website features, in the form of pop-ups, gives rise to annoyance in general, but also leads to better purchase decisions when the decision to be made is complex.

Our analysis shows that a monopolistic firm obtains a greater profit from offering a consumer-customizable product than from offering a preconfigured standardized product only if consumers are sufficiently capable to conduct the customization task; otherwise, it is more profitable for the firm to offer a standardized product. Moreover, consumers obtain a greater surplus when the firm offers the customizable product. We also consider the case where the firm is capable of offering both a customizable product and a standardized product and find that the firm benefits more from offering both products than offering either product if consumer customizing capability and the customization cost are not too high. Interestingly, when the firm offers both products, its effort in enhancing consumer customizability (e.g., offering free consumer training) always benefits both the firm and consumers, but its effort in increasing the value of the standardized product (e.g., offering more functions) can hurt both the firm profit and consumer surplus.

Combining rules requires the identification of the best combination of rules from the many combinations that might exist, and we use a maximum-likelihood framework to compare alternative combinations. Because it is impractical to apply the maximum likelihood framework directly in real time, we show that this problem can equivalently be represented as a set partitioning problem by translating it into an information theoretic context\u2014the best solution corresponds to the set of rules that leads to the highest sum of mutual information associated with the rules.

As mobile technologies can reach users anywhere and anytime, LMP becomes a promising new channel. We unravel the dynamic sales impact of LMP on the basis of a randomized field experiment with 22,000 mobile users sponsored by one of the largest mobile service providers in the world. Our identification strategy is to gauge the marginal increases in consumer purchases of the geo-fenced treatment group of users who received LMP, above and beyond the baseline control groups. There are two controls: one group who received the same LMP but not in the virtual geo-fencing locational range (nongeo-fenced control), and the other who did not receive the LMP but in the geo-fencing range (geo-fenced control). The latter control serves as an organic holdout baseline from the similar population, i.e., counterfactual test of what if without the mobile LMP intervention, to identify the actual \u201clift\u201d of incremental purchases caused by the treatment with the mobile LMP intervention. Findings suggest that LMP treatment has a significantly stronger impact on contemporaneous (same-day) purchases and delayed (subsequent-days) purchases than the controls. The randomized experiment design renders these findings robust to alternative explanations such as mobile usage behavior heterogeneity, product effects heterogeneity, nonrandomized sample-selection bias, and endogeneity concerns. Follow-up surveys with the field experiment users explore the nuanced mechanisms via which LMP may induce the impulsive, same-day purchases, and create product awareness for the planned subsequent-days purchases. LMP can generate six times more purchases than nongeo-fenced control with the LMP intervention, and 12 times more than geo-fenced control without the LMP intervention. LMP has a delayed sales effect for 12 days after the mobile promotions. The total sales impact of LMP could be underestimated by 54% if excluding the delayed sales impact and only including the contemporaneous impact.

We find that full disclosure accelerates the diffusion of attacks, increases the penetration of attacks within the target population, and increases the risk of first attack after the vulnerability is reported. Interestingly, the effect of full disclosure is greater during periods when there are more overall vulnerabilities reported, indicating that attackers may strategically focus on busy periods when the effort of security professionals is spread across many vulnerabilities.

Thus motivated, this study develops a model to explain the antecedents of both contributors\u2019 and lurkers\u2019 participation deriving from public participation and information technology-enabled public goods theories. It hypothesizes differences in the antecedents for contributors versus lurkers based primarily on construal level theory.

The results reveal significant differences in the participation antecedents of the two groups as hypothesized. Specifically, contributors are influenced by political career benefit and political efficacy motives, whereas lurkers\u2019 future participation intention is driven by collective benefits, possession of civic skills, and mobilization.

The patterns of findings are in line with the predictions of signal detection theory.

Our theoretical analysis suggests that the relative advantage of open versus sealed bid auctions hinges on the role of reducing service providers\u2019 valuation uncertainty (difficulty in assessing the cost to execute a project) and competition uncertainty (difficulty in assessing the intensity of the competition from other service providers), which largely depend on the relative importance of the common value (versus the private value) component of the auctioned IT services, calling for an empirical investigation to compare open and sealed bid auctions.

Furthermore, open bid auctions are 55.3% more likely to result in a buyer\u2019s selection of a certain service provider and 22.1% more likely to reach a contract (conditional on the buyer\u2019s making a selection) with a provider, and they generate higher buyer satisfaction.

To reconcile these contradictory findings, we propose that consumers can form initial beliefs about a product on the basis of the product\u2019s summary rating statistics (such as the average and dispersion of the product\u2019s ratings) and that these initial beliefs play a vital role in their subsequent evaluation of individual reviews.

They must also continue to behave securely. Positive outcomes of secure behavior may encourage the continuance of that behavior, whereas negative outcomes may lead users to adopt less-secure behaviors. For example, in the context of authentication, login success rates may determine whether users continue to use a strong credential or switch to less secure behaviors (e.g., storing a credential or changing to a weaker, albeit easier to successfully enter, credential). Authentication is a particularly interesting security behavior for information systems researchers to study because it is affected by an IT artifact (the design of the user interface). Laptops and desktop computers use full-size physical keyboards. However, users are increasingly adopting mobile devices, which provide either miniature physical keypads or touchscreens for entering authentication credentials. The difference in interface design affects the ease of correctly entering authentication credentials. Thus, the move to use of mobile devices to access systems provides an opportunity to study the effects of the user interface on authentication behaviors. We extend existing process models of secure behaviors to explain what influences their (dis)continuance.

We find that the nature of the prices that the auctioneer chooses to offer as feedback to the bidders can considerably influence their jump bidding behavior, leading to significant differences in auction outcomes. We demonstrate that in combinatorial auctions, in addition to the theories of jump bidding proposed in the literature, bounded rationality of the bidders plays a part in the nature and extent of jump bidding.

To address this question, we conduct an exploratory, theory-generating case study involving qualitative and computational analyses of development activities within an open source software community: Rubinius. We analyze the ongoing management of interdependencies within the community and find that unresolved interdependencies are associated with alternatively structured sequences of activities, which we define as routines.

Community members (even those unknown to the innovation\u2019s creator) may remix, taking the source innovation in directions the original innovator may have never imagined. Within online innovation communities, remixing is not bound by some of the constraints to knowledge collaboration found in more traditional environments. To address our research question, we begin with variables constituent to innovation diffusion theory, essentially remixing this long-established theory to predict cumulative remixing in online innovation communities, using arguments grounded in the user innovation and learning literatures. We also consider two forms of communication that are relevant to knowledge sharing in online communities (online community interaction and front page presence). Regression analysis (using data pertaining to 498 3D printable innovations) shows that community interaction is highly influential in determining which innovations are remixed by the community. Conversely, the innovation having a presence on the community\u2019s front page does not have a significant effect on remixing. Observability has an inverse-U-shaped relationship with remixing; this suggests the value placed on experiential learning. Fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) is used as a supplementary analysis technique (with robustness testing), and the results are largely consistent with regression findings but offer interesting insight into innovation configurations that consistently result in remixing from the community.

While these interruptions provide timely information, research shows they come at a high cost in terms of increased stress and decreased productivity. This is due to dual-task interference (DTI), a cognitive limitation in which even simple tasks cannot be simultaneously performed without significant performance loss. Although previous research has examined how DTI impacts the performance of a primary task (the task that was interrupted), no research has examined the effect of DTI on the interrupting task. This is an important gap because in many contexts, failing to heed an alert\u2014the interruption itself\u2014can introduce critical vulnerabilities.\nUsing security messages as our context, we address this gap by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore how (1) DTI occurs in the brain in response to interruptive alerts, (2) DTI influences message security disregard, and (3) the effects of DTI can be mitigated by finessing the timing of the interruption. We show that neural activation is substantially reduced under a condition of high DTI, and the degree of reduction in turn significantly predicts security message disregard. Interestingly, we show that when a message immediately follows a primary task, neural activity in the medial temporal lobe is comparable to when attending to the message is the only task.\nFurther, we apply these findings in an online behavioral experiment in the context of a web-browser warning. We demonstrate a practical way to mitigate the DTI effect by presenting the warning at low-DTI times, and show how mouse cursor tracking and psychometric measures can be used to validate low-DTI times in other contexts.\nOur findings suggest that although alerts are pervasive in personal computing, they should be bounded in their presentation.

The objective of the monitoring problem is to maximize the benefit of monitoring minus the monitoring cost. The key trade-off in our model is that as more sessions are monitored, the attack costs should decrease. However, the monitoring cost would likely increase with the number of sessions being monitored. A key step in solving the problem is to derive the probability density of a system with n sessions being monitored with a session\u2019s age measured as the time elapsed since it last generated a suspicious event. We next optimize the number of sessions monitored by trading off the attack cost saved with the cost of monitoring. A profiling step is added prior to monitoring and a resulting two-dimensional optimization problem is studied. Through numerical simulation, we find that a simple size-based policy is quite robust for a very reasonable range of values and, under typical situations, performs almost as well as the two more sophisticated policies do. Also, we find that adopting a simplified policy without using the option of managing sessions using age threshold can greatly increase the ease of finding an optimal solution, and reduce operational overhead with little performance loss compared with a policy using such an option. The insights gained from the mechanics of profiling and monitoring are leveraged to suggest a socially optimal contract for outsourcing these activities in a reward-based contract. We also study penalty-based contracts. Such contracts (specifically, when the penalty is levied as a percentage of the monthly service fee) do not achieve the social optimum. We show how an appropriate penalty coefficient can be chosen to implement a socially optimal penalty-based contract. In addition, we provide a high-level comparison between reward- and penalty-based contracts. In a penalty-based contract, the setting of the fixed payment can be challenging because it requires additional knowledge of the total expected malicious event rate, which needs to be observed through a period of no monitoring."}, "27/4/article13": {"year": "2016", "volume": "27", "issue": "4", "title": "More Harm Than Good?

In lieu of conducting self-report surveys or aggregate-level demand estimation, this research examines addictive behaviors on the basis of consumption quantity at an individual level. To empirically validate rational addiction in the context of social app consumption, we collect and analyze 13-month, individual-level panel data on the weekly app usage of thousands of smartphone users. Results indicate that the average social app user conducts herself in a forward-looking manner and rationally adjusts consumption over time to derive optimal utility. The subgroup analysis, however, indicates that substantial variations in addictiveness and forward-looking propensities exist across demographically diverse groups. For example, addictive behaviors toward social network sites are more myopic in nature among older, less-educated, high-income groups. Additionally, the type of social app moderates the effects of demographic characteristics on the nature of addictive behaviors.

To address these gaps, we propose the social media cyberbullying model (SMCBM), which modifies Akers\u2019 [Akers RL (2011) Social Learning and Social Structure: A General Theory of Crime and Deviance, 2nd ed.

Because Akers developed his model for crimes in the physical world, we add a rich conceptualization of anonymity composed of five subconstructs as a key social media structural variable in the SMCBM to account for the IT artifact. We tested the SMCBM with 1,003 adults who have engaged in cyberbullying. The empirical findings support the SMCBM. Heavy social media use combined with anonymity facilitates the social learning process of cyberbullying in social media in a way that fosters cyberbullying.

One of the forms of electronic commerce that we study is a webcast channel that allows electronic access to the traditional physical market, while the other is a standalone electronic market. Both forms provide traders with expanded reach to find and transact with each other across geographic distance, but only one allows traders to conduct transactions immediately, at any time.

To better understand such a novel pricing mechanism, we develop a game theoretical model and start our analyses with a market consisting of one merchant, one affiliate site, and consumers heterogeneous in their product valuation. From a price point of view, cash-back shopping appears to provide site users with a saving opportunity since the effective post-cash-back price they pay is perceived to be lower than the regular price targeted at nonusers. However, we find that under some conditions, this seemingly lower price could be actually higher, compared with the optimal uniform price when the merchant does not price discriminate. An important implication is that all consumers may end up suffering from higher prices in the presence of the cash-back mechanism. This surprising result, referred to as the cash-back paradox, defies a common intuition that a price-discriminating firm must raise the price for one segment of consumers but decrease it for the other. We also develop two extensions to seek explanations behind various industry practices. We find that it is in a merchant\u2019s best interest to affiliate with multiple sites, and the resulting competition improves overall market efficiency. Moreover, merchants who are disadvantageous in brand valuation should target price-sensitive consumers by strategically offering cash-back deals. Our results, consistent with several real-world observations, have useful implications for marketers.\nThe online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2017.0693"}, "28/2/article4": {"year": "2017", "volume": "28", "issue": "2", "title": "Online Cash-back Shopping: Implications for Consumers and e-Businesses", "authors": ["Ashish AgarwalMcCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712", "Alvin Chung Man LeungDepartment of Information Systems, College of Business, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR", "Prabhudev KonanaMcCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712", "Alok KumarSchool of Business Administration, University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida 33124"], "keywords": ["  online search", "  correlated search", "  user attention", "  network analysis", "  stock returns", "  supply chain "], "abstract": "The ability to make predictions based on online searches in various contexts is gaining substantial interest in both research and practice.

In this study, we investigate the extent to which institutional distance affects IOS-enabled knowledge sharing and its impact on the joint performance of collaborating firms.

Drawing on institutional theory, we propose that institutional distance, differentially influential via its normative, cognitive, and regulative aspects, not only reduces IOS-enabled knowledge sharing but also weakens the positive impact of such sharing on joint firm performance. Next, extending boundary object theory to the institutional context, we propose that IOS adaptability could be a solution to the challenge of institutional distance because it can directly strengthen IOS-enabled knowledge sharing as well as mitigate the negative effect of institutional distance on such sharing. Our hypotheses were tested through a field study that collected dyadic data from 141 distinct buyer/supplier channel relationships in 4 industries.

These nonfunctional attributes together are referred to as Quality of Service (QoS). When creating a new composite service, negotiation makes it possible for a service provider to offer the service with the QoS properties customized to the needs of a user. Automated negotiation tactics require the specification of reservation values for the QoS attributes. We present a methodology that determines the reservation values a user (or broker) should use for each component service based on the user\u2019s minimum requirements for the composite service. Our methodology maximizes the chance of reaching a successful negotiation outcome while staying within the user\u2019s reservation values for the composite service. We show that the problem of determining the user\u2019s reservation values for component services can be modeled as a multiobjective optimization problem and then transformed to a single-objective optimization problem using a max-min approach. The formulation can incorporate providers' different QoS preferences to increase the chance of negotiation success. We identify problem instances for which closed-form solutions can be found for the reservation values. We show how the method of setting reservation values can be incorporated into a negotiation process that uses extant concession and trade-off tactics. Simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. If some providers accept offers before the negotiation process deadline, we show that dynamically changing the reservation values for the remaining providers makes the overall negotiation process more likely to succeed.\nThe online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2016.0678."}, "28/2/article9": {"year": "2017", "volume": "28", "issue": "2", "title": "How High Should We Go?

A survey experiment with 547 U.S. consumers was conducted. The results show that perceived detection efficacy increases coping adaptiveness. Partially mediated by phishing anxiety, perceived phishing threat decreases coping adaptiveness. Coping adaptiveness positively impacts the two objective measures in the study, detection effort and detection accuracy. The results also suggest that coping adaptiveness and detection effort have different effects on false positives compared to false negatives: detection effort fully mediates the effect of coping adaptiveness on false positive rate (or detection accuracy related to legitimate emails), but has no impact on false negatives (or detection accuracy related to phishing emails), unlike coping adaptiveness. A post hoc analysis on coping responses reveals two patterns of coping among subjects, throwing more light on coping in phishing detection.

The goal of the ad network is to determine the sequence of fads shown to the user in an ad space to maximize the expected revenue generated over the user\u2019s app session. Mobile in-app advertising is uniquely suited for the sequencing of fads because user sessions are typically longer (than web sessions), and a single ad is displayed at any given point in time.

We study this question in the context of consumer valuation depreciation. Using a two-period game-theoretic model, we consider two types of consumer valuation depreciation for information goods or services: vintage depreciation and individual depreciation. Vintage depreciation assumes that a good or service loses some of its appeal to consumers as it becomes dated, and this effect persists independent of usage. Individual depreciation instead assumes that valuation depreciation happens only for consumers who have consumed or experienced the good or service. We identify conditions under which each pricing model is preferred. For vintage depreciation information goods, the leasing model dominates the selling model in vendor profit. For individual depreciation information goods, the selling model dominates the leasing model as long as the magnitude of individual depreciation exceeds a certain threshold; otherwise, leasing dominates selling. We consider several model extensions such as when network effects are present. Furthermore, we show a negative interaction effect between vintage depreciation and network effects in vendor profit. By contrast, the interaction effect between individual depreciation and network effects can be either negative or positive, depending on the magnitude of individual depreciation.

Our results suggest that an individual\u2019s decisions of whether to post a rating and what rating to post are affected by disconfirmation in two distinct manners. Specifically, an individual is more likely to leave a review when the magnitude of disconfirmation she encounters is larger. In addition, when the individual decides to review a product, the rating she chooses may not neutrally reflect her postpurchase evaluation; the direction of such a bias is in accordance with the sign of disconfirmation. We also observe several moderating effects: the disconfirmation effect on posting is attenuated by the time gap between purchase and receipt of the same product but accentuated by the dissension in product evaluations among peer consumers.

We develop a multilevel model of the effect of empowering leadership on the relationship between technical ISD risk factors and developers\u2019 role perceptions, and explore the consequences for developers\u2019 stress. The model was tested in a field study of 350 developers in 73 ISD teams from a large U.S.-based firm.

Project size, complexity, and target volatility were found to increase empowering leadership behaviors.
